<p>Are blondes or browns prettier? Yes maybe no no way, never! Honestly, the hair and eye color don�t matter nearly as much as the body. But blonde is fun and noticeable. Caucasian blondes are usually slightly higher in oestrogen than brunettes and are likely to exhibit other infantile sexually selected traits (indicating low levels of testosterone) that are considered desirable.</p>

<p>So polls like this are stupid. As a guy i don�t really care cos its the woman underneath the hair i love. Blondes have wealthier husbands because we are more fun and outgoing, and men are more attracted to us. she. Research suggests that blondes feature more often as playboy centerfolds than they do in women�s magazines, and the percentage.</p>

<p>Research suggests that blondes feature more often as playboy centerfolds than they do in women�s magazines, and the percentage of blondes in each type of magazine exceeds the base rate of blondes. Are blondes or browns prettier? When it came to women with other hair colors (yeah, hello!) 29.5% of men preferred blondes and 8.8% of men preferred redheads. It.</p>

<p>Since most women (and men ) are brunettes, the results will not reflect fairly on blondes or redheads. 28.6% said they prefer black hair.

<p>I think it just depends! Heck, even girls who died their hair pink. For blondes, pastel colours and jewelled colours are the ideal way to bring out your new hair colour, without it coming off as too bold. I like blue eyed blondes just fine. Real redheads are rare too.</p>
