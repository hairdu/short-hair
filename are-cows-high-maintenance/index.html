<p>Production is the high cost of maintenance. Contrary to what the mainstream beef industry continues to tell us, all attempts to increase production per cow, will have a negative effect on production and profit per acre. Maintenance energy alone is not a measure of biological or economic efficiency. Transition cows monitoring enables immediate detection of metabolic disorders, which are generated.</p>

<p>(2003) in a review of published literature (n=139 treatment means) and kebreab et al. Transition cows monitoring enables immediate detection of metabolic disorders, which are generated by the high maintenance and production requirements of the postpartum cow’s negative energy balance. Likewise, cows with higher maintenance requirements will have to eat more to support themselves, thus reducing total available forage more..</p>

<p>Do highland cows make good pets? If you are concerned about profit, this is a no. You need 50 pounds of calf weight to pay for it, and we’re a long way from that.” — david lalman My belief is that we have bred and are breeding cows or animals that are high maintenance.

<p>Never, ever walk in a field where there are cows with their calves. Holsteins have very low heritability. Cattle are relatively easy to take care of, and sanitary housing, good quality pasture, nutritious food, and plenty of sunshine will greatly reduce health problems. 2 to 5 acres of grassland are required per cow. Therefore, a staggering 50 percent of total.</p>

Approximately 71 percent of the total dietary energy expenditure in beef production is used for maintenance and 70 percent of the maintenance energy is required for the cow herd.

<p>Nothing wrong with high weaning weights or multiple births, however, both take more energy to maintain and require monitoring to make sure your stock are getting what they need. Highland cattle are renowned for being a low maintenance, hardy breed, but they still need some care. Production is the high cost of maintenance. This is why cattle with extremely high.</p>
