Beard Myth Does Shaving Make Your Beard Grow Faster? From gentlemansfoundry.com</p>
<p>Some popular beard myths about fast beard growth are: We’ll never have bald men if shaving regularly makes the beard hair grow faster. Hair doesn’t grow faster or slower (or darker, lighter, thinner or thicker) from shaving. As the others have stated, shaving doesn�t make your hair grow any faster.</p>
<h3 id="its-not-because-of-the-shaving-its-because-youre-getting-older">It’s not because of the shaving, it’s because you’re getting older.</h3><p>So, no, shaving doesn’t cause thicker and better beard, your genetics &amp; hormones are responsible for that matter. While the act of shaving or cutting your beard will not make your whiskers thicker or stronger, trimming/grooming can indirectly lead to better beard growth. In fact, if you are just starting to grow a beard, shaving every day might hinder beard growth in the end. When your beard grows, automatically the long tail of the beards seems to be smaller. Once you’ve shaved, you want to keep your skin clean and start exfoliating on a regular basis. Growing a beard may seem easy.</p>
