<p>This leaves your hair wavy and thick on top. There are few people with excessive body hair and 0 balding, they genetically have insensitive hair follicles. Once again hair loss is mostly down to genetics, so you may survive your whole life with a full thin head of hair or you may go bald at 25 with thick hair, it�s all luck of the draw. I believe this is largely hormonal, and i can only confirm that dutastride will reduce excessive body hair.</p>
<h3 id="well-there-are-a-couple-of-reasons">Well, there are a couple of reasons.</h3><p>This steady shedding is called “invisible baldness”, since the hair becomes gradually less dense until suddenly it is perceptible. That said, you don’t go bald all of a sudden, and that’s the good news, as it were. (bcoz you don�t have as much hair to lose as the latter)and remember, male pattern baldness can sometimes hit with such alarming speed that people with extremely thick hair lose all of it within 5 years or less. If you have curly, thick hair with a receding hairline, then you may simply want to go for an undercut or tapered fade on the sides. This leaves your hair wavy and thick on top. Well, there are a couple of reasons.</p>
