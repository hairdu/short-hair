<h3 id="do-not-let-your-hairdresser-try-to-tell-you-that-layering-your-hair-halfway-up-your-head-is-the-answer">Do not let your hairdresser try to tell you that layering your hair halfway up your head is the answer.</h3><p>It’s one of the best haircuts for thin hair because the “disconnected” style adds a lot of volume and texture.
