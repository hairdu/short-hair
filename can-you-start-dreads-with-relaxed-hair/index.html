Can You Start Dreads With Permed Hair Gerald Hipple Coiffure From riaquueta45.blogspot.com</p>
<p>Roll the hair you are combing between your fingers to help the process. The good news is that there is no one single method for starting dreadlocks. Remember, dreadlocks make your hair appear shorter than it is and they grow slowly. Create dreadlocks in uneven hair or only on part of your scalp if a mixed style looks good on you.</p>
<h3 id="start-combing-near-the-scalpless-than-an-inch-away">Start combing near the scalp—less than an inch away.</h3><p>Determine the size you wish to make your locks. On super curly hair, while you could start on hair about 3 inches, you want to keep as much of the hair when you begin. Start by moisturizing your hair with a natural oil like grapeseed or coconut oil about a day or so before you dye it. Comb repeatedly until the hair starts to pack up near the roots. You are old enough to finally have your hair permanent straightened. Make sure not to apply the bands too tightly or it can cause discomfort to the person getting the dreads.</p>
