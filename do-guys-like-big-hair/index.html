By and large, grooming body hair, or �scaping, can mean a light trim, a lined pattern, or complete removal. That being said, there’s more to attract a girl than just long hair.

And unlike generations past, where pubic hair was dictated by a societal norm (the big bushes of the swinging sixties, and the bold bald vaginas of the nineties for starters), we are enjoying total freedom to keep our pubes in whatever way we please,.
