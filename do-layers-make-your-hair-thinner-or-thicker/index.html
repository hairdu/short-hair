<p>These haircuts make thin hair look thicker and more voluminous. Remember that the more layers you have, the longer your hair will seem to be. If you have wavy, fine hair that is sparse (under average amount of hair per square inch or square centimeter ), cutting your hair into layers may make your hair look disheveled and unkempt.

<p>Blunt ends always make your hair look thicker, but if you�re a fan of layers, or that v shape, then you might have to part with it for a while until your hair grows and thickens. If you have wavy, fine hair that is sparse (under average amount of hair per square inch or square centimeter ), cutting your hair.</p>

<p>To go a step further, take a slice of hair underneath the bangs and color it two shades darker than the rest of the hair color, says hairstylist sam villa, education artistic director for redken. Think light, slightly feathered layers that don’t weigh your strands down. If hair is thin at the crown but still thick in front, try bangs.</p>
