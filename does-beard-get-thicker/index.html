<p>Since you cut the old and unhealthy growth, your beard got the chance to grow healthier. With that, the strands are durable; I am 22 years old and have very good density on my chin. The exposed follicles then produce a fresh new batch of beard that’s a little coarser than what was there before.</p>
<h3 id="it-may-still-be-uneven-or-patchy">It may still be uneven or patchy.</h3><p>Also, older men know how to look after their beards better and optimise their lifestyle to grow a thick beard. I would say my beard continued to improve at least until age 50, and may still be slowly improving. So this means up until the age of 19, you may not be able to grow a thick beard just because of hormones (testosterone levels) and genetics. Your beard does grow back quite quickly. Beards get thicker with age because a person has been exposed to testosterone for longer, and the hairs can be fully affected by this hormone. Do thin beards get thicker?</p>
