<p>Shaving does not have it grow back thicker or faster. So you should get your hair trimmed about 1 cm every eight to ten weeks by a hairdresser.

<p>Here are reasons for this belief and how to trim nostril hairs safely and effectively. Shaving or cutting hair increases thickness, density and makes it grow faster.

<p>The number one reason hair seems to “stop growing,” is because of split ends. Hair growth rate is unaffected by regular haircuts, color, or styling.
