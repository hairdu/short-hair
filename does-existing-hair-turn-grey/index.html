<p>Turning your gray hair into highlights is a fairly easy process. Yes it can after some time it will. Your hair doesn�t turn gray — it grows that way. The turn of the hair from a youthful, natural color to gray (and in many cases, back to its previous color) has been a puzzle that we�ve been pondering over for centuries.</p>

For most people, eventually all of those cells die and that�s why hair starts to turn grey. Gray hair is produced as melanocytes start to decrease the amount of melanin they add to the hair as it.
