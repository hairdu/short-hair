<p>This reduction in dht is enough to stop hair loss completely in over 80% of the males who take this medicine. In many patients we have found finasteride to hold on to a patient’s hair for at least 15 years. This means that you might not notice any improvement in your hair from finasteride, even though it’s constantly working by preventing any extra hair from falling out. Feel free to discuss hair loss remedies, research, technologies, transplants, living with hair loss, cosmetic concealments, whether to take the plunge and shave your head, and how your treatment progress or shaved head or hairstyle looks.</p>
<h3 id="most-men-should-expect-much-of-the-full-results-to-be-in-after-consistent-treatment-for-12-months">Most men should expect much of the full results to be in after consistent treatment for 12 months.</h3><p>This is because dht is more several times more androgenic than testosterone. We don’t have much longer data than that since it was approved for hair loss in 1998. Finasteride works by stopping the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (dht), the male sex hormone responsible for baldness. You will lose around 100 hairs a day, whether or not you take fin or any other dht blocker. You’re more or less subscribing to hair. Finasteride, a medicine, stops hair loss by reducing the amount of dht by about 70%.</p>

<p>Because mpb is genetic, the most effective way to stop and prevent further hair loss is to block dht production, which is exactly what finasteride does. Finasteride works well when you are young, but less well as you get older. This reduction in dht is enough to stop hair loss completely in over 80% of the males who take this.</p>

<p>To sum up, finasteride may meaningfully prevent hair loss only if the cause is due to excess dht. Finasteride only works while the drug is active in your body, meaning you’ll go back to a normal rate of hair loss once it’s excreted.
