<p>If you have wavy, fine hair that is sparse (under average amount of hair per square inch or square centimeter), cutting your hair into layers may make your hair look disheveled and unkempt. If you�re up for a new hairstyle, try going shorter with your hair and getting layers cut into it since short, layered hair tends to look thicker. Since 2013, i’ve been cutting hundreds of people and the 99% of people that are getting layered hair are extremely happy with it. Layers can make your hair look thicker, although this largely depends on the type of hair you have, as well as how much hair you have.</p>

Layers are designed to help thin out excess thickness or help boost volume, depending on the fullness and thickness of your hair. Contrary to the information above, stripping the hair of color still requires the opening of the cuticle layer. I was very hesitant to add layers to my thin/fine hair.</p>
