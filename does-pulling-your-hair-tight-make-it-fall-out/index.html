</center> <p><strong>Does Pulling Your Hair Tight Make It Fall Out</strong>, It�s especially noticeable with socks, because you pull them on against the natural flow of hair and they don�t move to let the hair settle back. Your hair goes through a natural growth cycle in which it grows to its full length, detaches from your scalp and eventually sheds.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" width="100%" src="https://hairdu.github.io/img/placeholder.svg" data-src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?q=does%20pulling%20your%20hair%20tight%20make%20it%20fall%20out" alt="Why Is My Hair Falling Out?

<p>So with all this in mind, can running your hands through your hair really cause your hair to fall out? If the hair is pulled back too tightly, it can break away from its roots, which may result in splitting, hair weakness, and follicle damage, so make sure you keep the start of the braid loose. Overuse of hot styling tools, such as your hairdryer, curling tong and straighteners, can make your hair dry, prone to breakage and consequently more likely. You develop traction alopecia from wearing your hair pulled too tight.</p>
<h3 id="wait-did-i-just-hear-psycho-strings">(wait, did i just hear “psycho strings?”)</h3><p>(bingo!) when you do this consistently over time, the constant tension will damage the follicle and your hair will fall out in that area. You develop traction alopecia from wearing your hair pulled too tight. For example, you might lose hair if you often: Both anorexia (not eating enough) and bulimia (throwing up after you eat) can make your hair fall out, because your body isn’t getting the nutrients it. Even if your hair grows out of the follicle healthy, any damage to the outside of hair with heat styling tools, tight braids and hairstyles, and yes, the friction of tight hats, could make even the healthiest hair become breakable and damaged. Otherwise you could experience permanent hair loss along your hairline, where your hair is the most fragile.</p>
