<p>If you’re a brunette, add some warmth to your look by asking your stylist for golden highlights. This way you’ll be ready for the summer plus ensure that your hair is making you look younger, not older! But if you really want long hair, we suggest your get hair extensions instead. Square, chunky layers are best.</p>
<h3 id="he-recommends-going-with-a-timeless-long-bob-or-as-short-as-an-inch-or-2-past-your-chin-think-of-my-girlfriend-kim-basinger039s-hair-in-9-12-weeks--hot-at-any-age-if-you-love-the-long-look-go-for-it">He recommends going with a timeless long bob or as short as an inch or 2 past your chin (think of my girlfriend kim basinger�s hair in 9 1/2 weeks — hot at any age). if you love the long look, go for it!</h3><p>That slight fade (we mean very slight, like idris elba here) will keep the eye fooled into more on top and less on the bottom. If you have an older woman who�s lost some volume, the layering should be kept to a minimum, particularly if they have fine hair, says zelno. Though a little volume can go a long way when it comes to making you look younger, opting for a short, spiky cut won�t do you any favors—in fact, it can make you look far older than you actually are. Assuming you should go short “don’t assume you have to go short as you get older,” kenyon says. A short hairstyle for older women can leave you looking fresh, healthy, and youthful. Warm tones do an exceptionally good job at making us look younger.</p>
