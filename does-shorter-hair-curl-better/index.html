<p>Is a curling wand better than a curling iron? This in turn will look like your hair curling up when it is longer. The shorter the curl, the tighter the coil, and the shorter it will bounce back. When you keep your hair healthy by taking proper care of your hair and hydrate it more, you’ll notice that your hair.</p>
