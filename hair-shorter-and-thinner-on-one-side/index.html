Did you cut or bang your head? Have been stressed due to rocky marriage right now but find it hard to believe only losing hair on one side of my head. When the hair follicle of one side of your head is scarred by inflammation or other skin conditions like lupus or lichen planus, then hair loss occurs on the affected side of your head. Short on one side long on the other. Whereas the other side has shorter hair that brings out the features.</p>

<p>It can occur in discrete patches, or more diffusely over larger areas of the head. This means that there are more hairs per square inch of scalp on the âthickerâ side, and fewer on the side that âlays flatterâ. Inflammation actually damages the sebaceous glands and stem cells on the scalp, resulting in bald spot or thinning of hair on.</p>

<p>Hair thinner and softer on one side i noticed one side of my hair is softer and thinner while both sides looks exactly the same. First off, why is this section so short?

<p>So i was wondering is this is normal due to maturity or is it early signs of something else. Male pattern hair loss can show up with thinning on the crown of your head, at the vertex (in an m or v shape), or a receding hairline. Leave the rest of the bangs open at one side. The best thing.</p>
