<p>It can occur in discrete patches, or more diffusely over larger areas of the head. This means that there are more hairs per square inch of scalp on the “thicker” side, and fewer on the side that “lays flatter”.

<p>Hair thinner and softer on one side i noticed one side of my hair is softer and thinner while both sides looks exactly the same. First off, why is this section so short?

<p>So i was wondering is this is normal due to maturity or is it early signs of something else. Male pattern hair loss can show up with thinning on the crown of your head, at the vertex (in an m or v shape), or a receding hairline. Leave the rest of the bangs open at one side. The best thing.</p>

<p>Do you sleep on one side and not the other?
