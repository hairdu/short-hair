<p>Fine hair and thin hair can easily be confused, but while fine hair refers to the thickness (or lack thereof) of the actual hair shaft, thin hair is about the density. The good news is that your hair is probably silky and soft to the touch. If you pick up a hair lock at the side of your hair and you don’t see any scalp then your hair density is thick, therefore you need smoothing hair products. You can also close your eyes while lightly touching your strands.</p>
<h3 id="is-easier-to-manage-when-layered">Is easier to manage when layered.</h3><p>If the strand is the same width as the thread, your hair is normal. If your hair is wispy or smaller in width than the thread, you most likely have fine hair. To determine whether your hair is fine, simply take a strand of hair and compare its size to a piece of sewing thread. If the hair strand looks thick and appears to be textured, then the hair is coarse. Whether you blow dry or air dry, make sure it�s all dry before you hit the sack. Simply roll a single strand around your fingers.</p>

<p>If you see a lot of scalp, you have thin hair density. When you have thick strands, sleeping on them when wet causes them to mat and tangle while you sleep, which isn�t going to look good or be easy to deal with when you get up. Also, fine hair has just two layers: Fine hair and thin hair can.</p>

<p>Knowing this will help you better determine which types of products you should gravitate towards. What you want to avoid is even the slightest hint of obvious layering. (if you don�t know how it looks, check the picture) twice. The bad news is that it’s hard to keep in a style because it’s slippery and doesn’t hold a curl well..</p>

<p>If you don’t see much scalp at all, you have thick hair density. If you can barely feel it, you probably have fine hair. if your strands feel neither wispy nor rough, you can assume you have medium. Thick hair meanwhile, can hold curls very well but can often be difficult to style as it’s typically less supple. If the.</p>

<p>Not sure what type of hair you have? To determine whether your hair is fine, simply take a strand of hair and compare its size to a piece of sewing thread. If your hair is wispy or smaller in width than the thread, you most likely have fine hair. If you don’t see much scalp at all, you have thick.</p>

<p>If you can’t really feel anything, this means the strands are fine. Now it pays to honestly discuss what you do and don’t want with the person holding the scissors. On the other hand, if you see some scalp then you might need a product to give your hair some volume on the roots. If the strand is thinner than.</p>

<p>If you have fine hair, your individual strands are smaller in diameter, while coarse hair has a thicker diameter. Large hair follicles, a ponytail with more than 2 inches of circumference, and clearly visible hair strands are some indicators of thick hair. Thick hair meanwhile, can hold curls very well but can often be difficult to style as it’s typically.</p>

<p>If the strand is the same width as the thread, your hair is normal. For instance if you have long, poker straight hair you probably want soft long layers to add a touch of movement. With thin hair, you can have thick hair strands but fewer of them. Coarse hair implies the circumference of each hair strand. Some people have.</p>

<p>Just so you know, the last two questions have absolutely no effect on your results, nor do the age and gender questions. Also, fine hair has just two layers: If the hair strand looks thick and appears to be textured, then the hair is coarse. A person with a thick hair texture will appear to have a fuller head of.</p>
