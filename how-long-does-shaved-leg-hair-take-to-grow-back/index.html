Does Shaving Make Hair Grow Back Thicker, Faster or More From youtube.com</p>
<p>Within about three months, you’ll notice about an inch and a half of new hair, especially since shaving your hair isn’t the same as plucking or losing it—the follicle bulb is still intact. The hair on your arms and legs has a cycle of about 30 to 45 days, as opposed to your head, which has a cycle of 2 to 6 years. First what happens is that on your arms it is really soft before it grows back and on your legs it is kind of soft and kind of rough because it is growing back and it takes a couple of years for the hair on your arms to grow back. In fact, it might take quite a bit longer.</p>
<h3 id="the-time-at-which-your-pets-fur-grows-back-is-based-upon-its-coat-length-the-season-and-other-factors">The time at which your pet’s fur grows back is based upon its coat length, the season, and other factors.</h3><p>You might even be left banging your head against the wall and asking, “does hair grow back?!” but not to worry. The hair on your arms and legs has a cycle of about 30 to 45 days, as opposed to your head, which has a cycle of 2 to 6 years. The amount of time it takes to grow back is different from everyone. When you first get a bad haircut, it might seem like your hair stops growing altogether for weeks on end. So shaving or plucking it will make it appear thinner, waxing or laser hair removal will make it even. This is also why body hair doesn’t grow quite as long as the hair on your head.</p>

<p>If your hair grows is too thick for you and you want it thinner, your only option is to remove it somehow.

<p>I did get a decent tan, but it was too much work to shave the whole summer. My younger one is 6 and i took her to petsmart to get a “trim” and the gal did a wonderful job doing just what i wanted. It will probably be about six months for most people. Shave the other one so that.</p>
