<p>It won’t last a week. It’s important to shave in the right direction for two reasons. The catagen phase only lasts for about 2 weeks, and only 2 or 3% of pubic hair is in this phase at a time.

<p>For some people, the hair may slowly grow back again after a week or two and may become more visible after three to four weeks. Apply it on the scalp and keep for 15 minutes. You’ll probably start to see new hair growth around 3. This means that the hair that’s trying to grow back gets trapped under the skin..</p>
