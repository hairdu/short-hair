</center> <p><strong>How Long Hair Fall Out After Pregnancy</strong>, Women may begin to experience postpartum hair loss two to four months after childbirth. Oestrogen levels increase during pregnancy, which can prolong the growth phase of the hair.</p>

<p>The rise in hormones during pregnancy keeps you from losing your hair. Generally speaking, though, postpartum hair loss typically starts soon after giving birth, and stops after around three to six months. At times it remains for a year. Rest assured that this is normal and temporary, and that this rate of hair loss will not continue.</p>
<h3 id="sometimes-postpartum-hair-loss-can-last-as-long-as-a-year-in-new-moms">Sometimes, postpartum hair loss can last as long as a year in new moms.</h3><p>However, women experience increased hair fall during events such as pregnancy and menopause. This causes more hair to go into resting mode and fall 4 months after delivery. During pregnancy, changes in your hormone levels cause your hair to stay in a resting stage for longer, so you lose less hair every day. By your baby�s first birthday you should have noticeable improvement. After delivery, the hormones return to normal levels, which allows the hair to fall out and return to the normal cycle. This means less hair falls out, making what you have gorgeously thick, healthy and shiny.</p>
