<h3 id="if-yourself-give-it-a-try-and-see-got-it-goes">If yourself, give it a try and see got it goes.</h3><p>Just because your hair is braided it does not mean that you cannot wash it. Two months is the absolute max i would suggest leaving your box braids in.” Otherwise, if your hair is relaxed or permed, then allow your roots to develop an undergrowth of virgin hair up to 1.5 inches.

The reason you should wait is that permed hair does not lock, and only virgin hair locks. Jun 16 2004 at 10:19pm:</p>
