<p>If you have very greasy hair or work out often, you can choose to wash it more often or every other day. If your scalp is dry and you have tight curls, washing once a week should be enough for you. Most experts agree that shampooing more than three or four times a week is too much, especially when you�re battling thinning hair. If you are trying to grow your hair longer, you can get away with trimming your hair every 12 to 16 weeks.</p>
<h3 id="you-dont-need-to-wash-your-hair-every-day">You don’t need to wash your hair every day.</h3><p>It�s best to thin a section at a time, and thin the same amount all around your head. Let it stay there for around 5 minutes. Washing more than that can strip your hair of its healthy natural oils. Deep conditioning treatments of course, there are more steps you can take other than altering how often you shampoo your hair. Make sure that you do not attempt to thin hair from the roots or the ends. However, just rinsing the hair out with water or using a conditioning product on the ends may not lead to further thinning.</p>
