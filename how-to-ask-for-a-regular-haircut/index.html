<p>If you’re not sure, ask the barber to see the guards and compare. The length of a taper can vary. Short (when describing layers) simply defines the distance between one layer and the next.

<p>Ask your hairstylist for the healthiest, most manageable cut based on your hair�s health, your individual lifestyle, and your desired hairstyle. First of all don�t go to a cheap saloon to get a haircut especially for a trim (if you want a good trim). Guard size refers to length) you prefer. For cuts requiring a more frequent upkeep, that can.</p>
