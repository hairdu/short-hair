<p>When you’ve finished curling your hair, run your fingers through. Then, hold the flat iron vertically and slightly tilted away from the head, and twist until the flat iron has done two turns, and pull the flat iron down through the section of hair whilst it is turning. Once i chopped it off, the curls took over and i have received tons of compliments on my hair in the 1.5 years since the big chop. Using a microfiber towel, gently squeeze out any excess water from your roots so they do not dry flat.</p>
