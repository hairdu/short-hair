<p>I have always gone to the cheap hair cut places (fantastic sams for example) and just had 1/2 an inch cut off the bottom to keep the ends healthy. Trim the two strands together to make sure the lengths are even. To cut your own long hair, start by parting your hair down the middle, then pull it into a low ponytail at the nape of your neck. Continue in this manner until you have cut the entire bottom layer of hair.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-want-the-layers-to-be-very-accentuated-do-a-higher-ponytail">If you want the layers to be very accentuated, do a higher ponytail.</h3><p>Comb it quickly again, and bring it all back to the front. Now, with your scissors, cut it straight, a few inches from the ends (trust us, this works). This way, you don�t hurt your little one�s scalp, or pull on their head, says tesler. Use a wide tooth comb and slowly comb all the tangles out, being gentle. Longer hair is more forgiving— whereas with a bob, if the line is off, it will be noticeable. Pick a side and start at the back.</p>
