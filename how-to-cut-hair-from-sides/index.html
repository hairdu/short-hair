<p>Damp hair is much easier to work with than either wet or dry. (if your hair is on the shorter side and you have trouble combing it backward, simply comb it away from your part.) Pull the hair with your fingers perpendicular to your head, then cut a small amount off the ends (1/2 to 1/4 of an inch). The result is sharp angles, clean lines, and lots of volume.</p>

To do so, comb your hair away from your part and backward as well. Then, i blended my newly trimmed ends into my new face framing layers but using point cutting to.
