<p>Remember to keep your fingers placed vertically so you layer the hair. Simply comb all your hair smooth and lay comb flat against skin, then cut hair above comb. Make sure your child’s hair is clean and dry before you begin. Regular scissors tend to be dull, or at least duller than shears. Step 1, put a towel over the.</p>

<p>But let’s say you start at the neckline. If there�s one thing you can pretty much bet on as a parent, it�s that your kid is going to give themselves a haircut at some point during their childhood. As you cut, hair will fall onto his neck and shoulders. When you cut fabric with a dull pair of scissors, the.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever tried to teach kids how to cut with scissors, you may have ended up with a snipped finger or two.teaching kids how to cut on lines can be a tricky thing. I can actually attest that this is true. Hair dressers get their scissors sharpened quite often. This was a fun way to get both my preschooler.</p>

<p>The rest of us will use the kitchen scissors, craft scissors or those tiny ones daddy usually reserves for trimming his mustache. Hold a small piece of hair between your fingers, then slide your fingers down until the hair is the length you want it, and snip below your fingers. Hair is super dulling to scissors. Remember to keep your.</p>

<p>When it comes to cutting bangs, it’s easier to cut them dry because you’ll be able to see exactly where each section of hair will fall across the forehead. Simply comb all your hair smooth and lay comb flat against skin, then cut hair above comb. Typically, the lower the number, the shorter the haircut. Use your comb to brush.</p>

<p>This was a fun way to get both my preschooler and my toddler (under 2) involved in one simple scissor skills activity. As you cut, hair will fall onto his neck and shoulders. Make sure to cut the same length all around at first and then go back through for any layering. All good and perfect parents will have a.</p>

<p>As with the sides and back, each new cut should have a few hairs from the previous cut to serve as a guide. Use one hand to hold your child’s head (no vise grip, please) so you don’t have a moving target (and better control means you can keep the scissors away from skin and eyes). I place my fingers.</p>
