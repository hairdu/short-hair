<p>The tricky thing with the back part is that it’s going to be slightly longer. Brush your hair again and tie another elastic band at the point where you want to cut your hair. Bring the sections in the back forward to join your two front sections. Pass the hands through your hair, and place a ponytail holder a few.</p>

<p>Hold one hand securely around the bunch of hair. Cut the hair in one section straight across below the second elastic band. Spread out the hair evenly and cut it straight across.
