<p>(i like to hang on to the baby hair as long as possible, so when they were babies they would get a trim when i got my hair cut!) Bangs with cowlick hair like this are very easy to maintain. It�s always going to be there. Cut the hair on top of the head first;</p>
<h3 id="comb-it-into-place-and-train-it-again-with-the-comb-as-you-apply-heat">Comb it into place, and train it again with the comb as you apply heat.</h3><p>It�s always going to be there. Even if you have cowlicks, side bangs are great for styling. Not because it was cute, but because if we let it go, it would just get taller and taller. One of the best ways to control front cowlick for men is by cutting the hair incredibly short and then forcing it to lay as flat as possible with product. A double cowlick most people�s hair grows in a circular flattened pattern from a central point. Some girls prefer to wear them layered and overgrown.</p>

<p>Welcome to our hair consultations column. The cowlick is the point where the hair changes direction.
