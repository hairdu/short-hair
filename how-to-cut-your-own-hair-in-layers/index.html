<p>The disappointment and dissatisfaction do too. If you have short hair, it�s relatively simple to add layers to it. Cutting layers into your own hair is definitely a topic many seem to want help with. It�s all about going straight down from your guide. Adding layers gives the hair more width and volume.</p>

<p>Tie it very well so that it is firm. How high depends on the layers you want (which i will discuss below). Comb it very well until there are no knots. This is the first layer of your cut. This is where the angle you hold the section comes into play.</p>

<p>Layers can be added to any length hair, from short to long. I was looking for a way to layer my 2yr old daughter�s hair. If you don’t have a spray bottle, wet your hair brush and brush through all of the hair so that the moisture is evenly distributed.[1] x research source use any sort of hair brush, though.</p>

<p>Bring all of your hair forward and style it so that it is evenly across the scalp. Comb it very well until there are no knots. Double check everything by examining your hair in the mirror. Take a section of the hair of the left side near your chin or cheek level (whichever level you prefer), and then start snipping.</p>
