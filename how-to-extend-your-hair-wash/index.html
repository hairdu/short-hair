<h3 id="if-you-think-you-are-overwashing-your-hair-try-cutting-out-one-wash-per-week-or-extending-the-time-between-washes-by-a-day">If you think you are overwashing your hair, try cutting out one wash per week or extending the time between washes by a day.</h3><p>Shampoo is great, but it can have damaging effects on your hair and scalp too. It’s an awesome way to refresh hair between washes, and it also adds texture to your hair, so it will hold a curl.
