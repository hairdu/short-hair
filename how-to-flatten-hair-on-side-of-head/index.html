<p>Don’t cut the hair on the side of your hair. My suggestions would be to get long layers cut in there, to help it not to be so flat, and then, i don�t know if you already diffuse or not, but using a diffuser always really helps me to get volume. When you switch your hair�s part to the other side of your head, the roots will lift and give you more volume. 10% off all karmin products.</p>
<h3 id="during-showering-use-lukewarm-water">During showering, use lukewarm water.</h3><p>During showering, use lukewarm water. 10% off all karmin products.

I have asian hair and it always sticks out from the sides, giving my head an even rounder shape than it already is. To combat this, i�m trying to have the front part of my hair to have more volume while the sides are flat.</p>
