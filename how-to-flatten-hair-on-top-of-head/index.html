<p>Whether your wig is synthetic or made of human hair, always remember to straighten with the minimum heat setting possible. Bend over at the waist, gathering your curls in a loose ponytail on top of your head. For a wig made of human hair, a flat iron is an option. Having fine, flat hair might seem easy to style.</p>
<h3 id="a-part-in-the-middle-will-help-you-bring-the-hair-over-your-shoulder-and-around-the-side-of-your-head-where-you-will-be-able-to-straighten-it-more-easily">A part in the middle will help you bring the hair over your shoulder and around the side of your head where you will be able to straighten it more easily.</h3><p>Too much will make hair look greasy. Brush your hair before bed to remove knots and gently twist your hair up on top of your head and wrap it with a silk scarf to prevent new tangles from forming. Once you have combed through your entire head of hair and removed all of the tangles, start organizing your hair into sections. User pynzrz is correct in saying you need longer hair to begin with in order for it to lay flatter naturally, as well as in saying you should see stylists who specialize in/have extensive knowledge of asian hair. If you�re currently washing your hair every day, try to cut back to every second day. Instead, gather your hair up into a clip, comb or elastic band on top of your head before you shower (now you can put on that shower cap)!</p>
