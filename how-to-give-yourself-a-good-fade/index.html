So, while the fade starts from the bottom, if your top is too long, start by cutting it with scissors to the length you want it to have in the end. Giving yourself a fade haircut can be done as long as you have mirrors and the right styling equipment.</p>
<h3 id="for-a-very-short-fade-ask-them-for-a-1-or-2-sized-clippers">For a very short fade, ask them for a 1 or 2 sized clippers.</h3><p>Some people like to have a buzz cut that has multiple levels to it. You’ll want a kit that comes with plastic guards, which slip onto your clippers to control the length of your cut.

That means using different guard and blade sizes in descending order as you move away from the borderline between the top part of your head and the beginning of your fade. Use clippers on the back, sides, and nape and styling scissors on the top. Yes it takes time and patience but when you do master it, you will look fresh constantly.</p>
