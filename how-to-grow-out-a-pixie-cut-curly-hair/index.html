<p>Stop when you reach your ear. If your pixie is a bit longer or you have some uneven layers, you may be able to use bobby pins to accessorize as well. After a month of my cute pixie cut i decided to search via the internet on how to gracefully grow out my pixie. One of my favourite beauty bloggers, phyrra, is at the start of her transition from short to long hair.</p>
<h3 id="style-short-hair-with-hair-accessories">Style short hair with hair accessories.</h3><p>How long did it take you? Curl if you feel so inclined. Make sure to give your roots proper attention so your hair starts out as healthy as possible. While you don’t need to get a trim every six to eight weeks, you should head to. Taking clinically proven supplements, like nutrafol or viviscal, can speed up the hair growth process. Just twist and pin sections of your hair back, and voila.</p>
