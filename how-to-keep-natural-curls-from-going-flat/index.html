<p>If you wish to flaunt straight hair styles occasionally, a ceramic/ionic flat iron would be a great choice. Now, you’re ready to take on the world with those. I would also like to point out that if your true texture is 2a, it doesn�t fall flat, your hair just assumes it�s natural state when it dries. Bend over at the waist, gathering your curls in a loose ponytail on top of your head.</p>
<h3 id="if-you-have-naturally-curly-hair-a-little-sea-salt-spray-brings-out-the-bounce-and-lets-the-curls-be-a-little-more-full">If you have naturally curly hair, a little sea salt spray brings out the bounce and lets the curls be a little more full.</h3><p>Here are a few additional tips and tricks that have been tried and tested by the experts of the hair industry: View this post on instagram a post shared by sabrina porsche (@sabrina.porsche) For really full, natural curls, simply pulling all your hair up and over near your forehead and securing it while you sleep will allow you to keep your hair from literally falling flat.

If you have long hair, one way to help your curls last is to pull your hair loosely to the top of your head and secure lightly with a scrunchie. When i get the right amount in my curls look great, even in the morning, but throughout the day they start to go flat and turn dull and frizzy.</p>
