<p>Then you can go, “that was really hideous,” or “that was not so good because it was too bright, but it’s not so hideous.”. Then go to the other end of the spectrum, which is a really blue, pinkish color and try that on as well. There are no hard and fast rules for the over 50s and i think.</p>

<p>I would look at the same clothes for many ages from 35 upwards. You do not need to be a stick, thin billowy model to dress well. Go for a graphic elements and asymmetrical shapes. Keep obvious designer nods to a minimum, and instead invest in subtle accessories that will get your recognised for your style, not your spending power..</p>

<p>I think that after a certain age your skirt should really be at or below the knee, no matter how beautiful your legs are. If you’re wearing an updo, leave a few tendrils to hang. You can easily look fabulous in your 50s. Graphic prints, bold stripes and heavy duty details up the style ante for edgy gals. Just take.</p>

<p>I would look at the same clothes for many ages from 35 upwards. Even if you�re in your 50s and you haven�t gained an ounce since your 30s, clothes just don�t fit the same. In your 50s, a drainpipe suit with a slim lapel can be pretty difficult to pull off. You can look equally chic in kitten heel slingbacks,.</p>

<p>Eternally stylish women find their look and modify it as they grow older; Shop similar tights here, here, and here. There are no hard and fast rules for the over 50s and i think that in many ways age is a state of mind. If it gets a bit warmer but you still want a jacket to keep your body.</p>

<p>Every outfit should have one major focal point. Even if you�re in your 50s and you haven�t gained an ounce since your 30s, clothes just don�t fit the same. In the photo above i am wearing my classic black waisted jacket. Many women over 50 don’t like to wear stilettos and that’s okay. ‘in my book, i am not trying.</p>
