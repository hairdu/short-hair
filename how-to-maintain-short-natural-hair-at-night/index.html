<p>Having a natural hair regimen is more than the products you choose to put on your hair. Now you know about several ways to wrap your hair up at night, and you’ve gathered a ton of helpful tips to help you along. It’s not always about keeping curl definition, but also keeping your hair moisturized and smooth. Use a satin.</p>

<p>Use a satin bonnet or scarf. Wear a satin cap to protect your hair and maybe. Once you straighten your hair, learn how to maintain your style until the next shampoo. Use hair oil purchased from a drugstore, or mineral or olive oil. The ends of your hair tend to be drier that your roots, so a little extra moisture.</p>

<p>Make sure your ends are secure in the scrunchie. After your hair is dry or mostly dry, comb gently from roots to ends to distribute natural oils from your scalp into the ends of your hair. So there isn�t a one size fits all method for protecting natural hair at night. When you come up, your hair will bear resemblance.</p>

<p>Use a satin bonnet or scarf. It also includes what you do to maintain your hair. As a general rule, i always treat and style my curls in the late afternoon to early evenings to allow my treatments to soak in and work their magic with time left over to wash it out. It really depends on what you want.</p>

<p>Otherwise, pull your hair into a “pineapple” with a scarf and repeat nightly. Sleeping on a cotton pillowcase can easily mess up your style and create frizz overnight. So what’s the problem, you ask? I have to admit that having short, natural hair can become challenging at times, especially with wash &amp; go�s. Make sure your ends are secure in.</p>

<p>Pineappling is an excellent tool for natural hair. Use a satin bonnet or scarf. If i don’t, my roots will start to get puffy in the first week. Apply treatments or style in the late afternoon or early evenings. That is the key to ensuring that you maintain healthy hair, whether it is day or night.</p>
