<h3 id="learn-how-to-make-hair-shiny-using-diy-methods-and-ingredients-you-have-at-home-including-natural-masks-hair-rinses-scrubs-and-more">Learn how to make hair shiny using diy methods and ingredients you have at home, including natural masks, hair rinses, scrubs, and more.</h3><p>Since textured hair tends to be dry, it’s even more important to make sure your hair is properly moisturized. It coats the hair cuticle, moistens and detangles making hair manageable by removing curls and frizz. If you are washing your hair in large twists or braids, take the time to unravel each twist or braid and apply hair conditioner properly to coat each strand of hair. Take a multivitamin containing minerals like zinc and copper, which prevent premature greying. I prefer natural oils like olive oil, avocado oil, or coconut oil, as they�ve proven to be effective sealants over the course of my five year natural hair journey. Because of the extremely dry texture, many hairstylists have also suggested the use of mayonnaise as one homemade conditioner that will leave your hair feel a lot softer.</p>
