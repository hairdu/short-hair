<p>To finish, look lightly tousle hair while adding in a few spritzes of sea salt spray, like suave professionals texturizing sea salt spray, to create added texture and lasting grip to help your faux bob stay put. Tie it off at the end, then roll this into a bun and stick it to the base of your head. You can.</p>

<p>You can tussle your hair and push it slightly to one side, creating a somewhat spiked and sloppy look. Jerome lordet, master stylist at pierre michel salon, told me to try using only your fingers with the head upside down, pulling on the roots to give more volume.

<p>Pull your hair together at the nape of the neck, tie with an elastic near the ends and tuck them.

<p>Use a shearing technique to thin strands. If you make the curve too deep or too shallow, the sides of your skirt will be shorter or longer than the center. Using a lightweight hair oil after the shower will help seal in moisture and is especially important for curly, coarse, and textured hair. Use a bobby pin to pin the.</p>
