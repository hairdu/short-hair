<p>Today i show you how i wrap my straight hair style for the night time! Medium to longer braids and box braids. Place a small bottle of lemongrass oil in a cup of hot water to let the oil become more fluid, then apply the oil to your ends (or all the way up to your scalp if needed), and put your hair in a high bun or a braid. Create a bun high on your head so that you can sleep without pain or distraction.</p>
<h3 id="brush-your-hair-after-you-wake-up">Brush your hair after you wake up.</h3><p>To avoid having your hair get frizzy overnight, sleep on a satin or silk. Use a dry shampoo and apply it to your roots at night to clean and protect your hair. Box braids need to be fully wrapped prior to tying the scarf in order to protect the entire length of the plait, not just the scalp. If so, what method do you use? Covering your hair allows some of this oil to be absorbed by the scarf or bonnet and therefore. Wrap your hair in a silk scarf.</p>
