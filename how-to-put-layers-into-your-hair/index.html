<p>Cut the middle section of your hair 1/2 to 1 inch shorter than the bottom layer. Section out the bottom part of your hair and braid it so that you will not cut it. Usually, the hair is cut into shorter lengths on top and around the crown and then varying lengths through the rest of the hair to add texture, says andrew barton, headmasters creative and communications director. This style has your hair layered both in the front and the back.</p>
<h3 id="use-a-ruler-to-measure-the-amount-of-hair-you039ll-need-to-remove-to-achieve-the-desired-length">Use a ruler to measure the amount of hair you�ll need to remove to achieve the desired length.</h3><p>Long layered cuts, circle cuts and beveled cuts are all considered a layered style. The different layers add personality to the curls and make them stand out more.

This leaves the bottom third ready for initial cutting. Use the scissors to trim the tips of your hair, then move on to the next section. By the way, you cannot cut the thick hair with regular cutting scissors, but you can buy a pair of hair shears, they have grooves on the cutting edge to help keep your hair in place when you are cutting it.</p>
