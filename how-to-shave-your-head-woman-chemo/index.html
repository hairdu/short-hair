<p>And, in fact, i’m way out there, i guess. Apply your regular conditioner and comb through your hair with the conditioner in. Wash your hair and scalp less often and be sure to use a gentle shampoo. I guess the point of all this rambling, is that you can and should do what you want about shaving your head. One.</p>

<p>I also respect those who choose to let it fall out. Because of this, fully shaving the scalp may result in added irritation once the hair starts to grow back in and emerge through the scalp. The best way to measure your head is to use a measuring tape and measure around your hairline, starting at the forehead, around the.</p>

<p>Nicki serquinia shares her best tips on how and when to get the clipper out and most importantly what. However, more importantly, the chemo may also have made the scalp more sensitive and susceptible to irritation. Make it an event where loved ones can offer support through your chemotherapy. One option for cutting your hair before it falls out is.</p>

<p>Make it an event where loved ones can offer support through your chemotherapy. The lining of your mouth and your gastrointestinal tract are also areas that have a high rate of cell turnover, so patients going through chemo often experience mouth sores and diarrhea. Chemo is something that i went through to help save my life and it did not.</p>

<p>Shave it all off early or let it fall out slowly. During chemotherapy it�s also best not to use blow dryers, curling irons, hair dyes and other hair and scalp treatments. Be careful not to rub your head vigorously or avoid pulling on your hair with a comb, brush, or towel. I also respect those who choose to let it.</p>
