<p>This is why a wavy hair needs a gel or mousse to hold the texture when the hair dries (a slightly different principle to when your hair is straight and curled in the shower). Spray flexible hold hairspray on your wet curls to help speed up drying time. The process of successful drying curly hair begins while your hair is.</p>

<p>Wiley recommends investing in a microfiber towel, which will cut your drying time down, absorbs excess water, and is softer on the hair. That starts in the shower. Everyone is like ‘don’t brush your curly hair ever!’ but mine is so nuts, i have to or the curls come out thick and knotted; Once your hair is 100% dry, it.</p>

<p>It may feel like a lot. If you have black hair, the wet look creates a gorgeous blue sheen. This post is part 2 to my last one all about the common causes of wet frizz &amp; webbing. Spritz your hair with water to reawaken your curls. This is normally because the water makes your hair heavy and stretched, so.</p>

<p>That starts in the shower. The roots take the longest time to dry so speed it up by diffusing them before you run out the door! This is the last time you will comb your hair. Rake thoroughly 3 or 4 times, so that your hair is evenly clumped between your fingers. Everyone is like ‘don’t brush your curly hair.</p>

<p>Long hair looks so good when it’s wet. Comb gently, as wet hair is more prone to breakages. For some curlies it can take hours for their hair to air dry, so one way to speed up the process is by using a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer. It will not feel the same once it dries.

<p>Rake thoroughly 3 or 4 times, so that your hair is evenly clumped between your fingers. Like wavy hair, allow your hair to air. Start with wet, clean hair, and begin by working in small, manageable sections. Set each section of hair, either by applying product or by finger coiling. When your hair is partially dry, flip your head upside.</p>
