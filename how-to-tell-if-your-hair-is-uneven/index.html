<h3 id="if-you-spot-an-area-that-looks-thinner-than-normal-it-may-be-an-early-warning-sign-that-youre-starting-to-develop-a-receding-hairline">If you spot an area that looks thinner than normal, it may be an early warning sign that you’re starting to develop a receding hairline.</h3><p>To test your hair�s porosity, clamp a section of your hair between your index finger and middle finger.

However, if the hairline is very uneven, then it is likely a receding hairline.</p>
