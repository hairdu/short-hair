<h3 id="once-a-hair-strand-splits-at-the-end-the-damage-will-only-progress">Once a hair strand splits at the end, the damage will only progress.</h3><p>Left untouched, a split end will continue to split all the way up the hair shaft, damaging the entire strand beyond repair.split ends no longer have a smooth cuticle covering them, so they naturally catch and snag on each other and on healthy ends. Dyes, relaxers, and perms look amazing in our curly hair, but they can make it feel a little dehydrated. This method of trimming the split ends requires the use of heat and it works best for people with curly hair. You only need to clip off about 0.13 inches (0.33 cm) of hair. Every time you blow dry, flat iron, or use hot rollers, you are contributing to breakage and split ends. Focus your efforts on the roots, the healthiest part of the hair.</p>
