<p>But genetics are tricky, and there’s a chance that two parents with curls could carry the straight hair recessive gene, and pass that onto their offspring. Cc represents the curly hair gene, and ss represents the straight hair gene. It’s possible that one (or even both) of your parents carry the curly hair gene, but it’s only contributing to their physical appearance in the form of a slight or barely noticeable wave. For those who are going to have curly hair, the voluminosity of the strands will show every time babies wake up with bedhead.</p>

For those who are going to have curly hair, the voluminosity of the strands will show every time babies wake up with bedhead. On average humans have about 20,000 to 25,000 genes which are the building blocks of the 46 chromosomes. As for the texture of baby�s hair,. For example, if both parents have brown hair the probability of your parents having brown hair is about 99%.

<p>You, however, have straight hair and since we now know that you need two h ’s to get that trait, they both must have had one as well. If you have curly hair, your genotype is two curly hair versions of the hair texture gene: If you have two curly alleles (cc), you’ll have curly hair. That is because the.</p>

<p>If two heterozygous parents have a child the chance that the child has wavy hair will be 50% (1/2). But genetics are tricky, and there’s a chance that two parents with curls could carry the straight hair recessive gene, and pass that onto their offspring. At an intersection where the two parents are homozygous dominant, all offspring are homozygous dominant,.</p>
