It may appear thicker but that�s only because the fine ends of the hair have been removed.

Keep this in mind if you’re still asking your stylist “should i cut my hair short?” while sitting in the salon. For best results, try all four tips at once. This will really make your hair look like it�s huge and full of volume.</p>
