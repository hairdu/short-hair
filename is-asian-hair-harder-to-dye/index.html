19+ Nice Hair Color For Asian Skin From haircutcolor.blogspot.com</p>
<p>The best asian hair colors are those that flatter your skin tone. To me the quality of it just seems so amazing. While this may not be natural hair, dyed hair still requires maintenance and there are specific products which help with the upkeep of dyed hair. But those days are long behind us!</p>
<h3 id="asian-hair-is-harder-than-other-ethnicities-to-dye-but-that-does-not-mean-you-cannot-achieve-a-beautiful-color-or-shade">Asian hair is harder than other ethnicities to dye, but that does not mean you cannot achieve a beautiful color or shade.</h3><p>Jessie chen(@aye.jessiee), andrea lee(@endrealee), chelsea(@calystra), alyssa(@itsalyssaskins), tori(@pinkyt03). Bleached hair is a lot more porous , so the cuticle has lots of gaps in it, and water can enter and leave hair very easily. Take it slow, and lighten your hair in stages. Also know that it is very expensive to bleach your hair and tone it, and maintain and take care of it. However, he adds that asian hair has another unique element to it that makes lightening more difficult—an extra cuticle, which makes strands appear healthy and shiny in their natural state, but also makes colour even harder to lift. You might want to look into finding someone in sj or daly city, specifically ones that work with asian hair (you don’t have to be asian, but asian hair is harder to bleach).</p>

<p>Once upon a time, asian hair was difficult to dye. Also, you not only have to lift the hair at many levels but also deal with several layers in the undercoat.

<p>On the downside asian hair is just harder to colour if you wanted to, because being dark brown or black, bleach needs a long time and damages it more.
