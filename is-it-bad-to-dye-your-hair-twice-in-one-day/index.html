<p>Still, you should expect to. Your hair needs time to restore after the toner exposure before undergoing a more aggressive coloring procedure. Dying it again should not damage it, but may not make that much difference to how light it is. Mine lasted through i don�t know how many times and i can�t tell you howany colors.</p>
<h3 id="mine-lasted-through-i-don039t-know-how-many-times-and-i-can039t-tell-you-howany-colors">Mine lasted through i don�t know how many times and i can�t tell you howany colors.</h3><p>There are many people who claim to have done it with success, but we all have different hair and situations. With all those risks in mind, you might be running for the hills—but hey, don’t totally write off the affordable hair color just yet. Depending on the situation, it�s best not to color your hair twice in one day especially if bleach is involved with one or both processes, as it�s healthiest for the hair to be allowed to return to its normal ph over the course of a few weeks before bleaching or coloring again. However, naturally dying your hair dark colours multiple times in one night would cause the hair to be stripped of it�s natural oils, thus drying it out. If your hair is unhealthy and vulnerable, you should wait for a period of time before dying. Take time to minimize your damage.</p>
