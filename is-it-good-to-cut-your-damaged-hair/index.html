Cutting Damaged Hair &quot;Corrective Cut&quot; Morrocco Method From youtube.com</p>

If your tresses are damaged and your ends are breaking, brittle and splitting, a haircut will save the day. The longer you leave split ends, the more likely they are to climb up your hair shaft. The key is to learn how to dry your hair the right way.</p>
