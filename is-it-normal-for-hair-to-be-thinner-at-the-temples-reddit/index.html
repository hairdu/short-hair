My hairline is thinner on my temples on both sides, but the left is more concerning because it is larger and more noticeable. I�m hopping i can grow back my right side to where my left is, but it�s too early for me.</p>

<p>Most people naturally have baby hairs around their hairline and by their temple. More hairs on your brush or pillow than normal. Although this kind of hair loss is common in both men and women, it is characteristic of male pattern baldness, where thinning starts at the temples rather than from the top of the head.

No one’s hair is perfectly symmetric, especially when a person is.</p>

<p>These are a part of your juvenile hairline and may go away with age. Temple hair loss is basically the thinning of hair at the temples. Temple hair loss can also just take place on just one side.
