<p>If the cat has developed a lump on its head, possible causes are: Jan 29, 2009 at 3:30 pm. If you see it getting any thinner over the years/months then start looking into treatments (or just accept it). See your doctor if you�re concerned about how much hair you are losing every day.</p>
<h3 id="thinning-at-the-top-of-your-head-hair-is-probably-the-most-common">Thinning at the top of your head hair is probably the most common.</h3><p>It can be the result of heredity, hormonal changes, medical conditions or a normal part of aging. Examples are crib mattresses, playpens, and infant seats. You can’t see the spot when her hair is down, but when it is up you could notice it if you concentrated on that part of her head. It�s normal to have up to about 15% of the hairs in a miniaturized state. Thinning at the top of your head hair is probably the most common. I hope this information is helpful to you.</p>
