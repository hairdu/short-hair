<p>Long hair, for some women, is. That�s what i don�t get, it�s bad for men but not for women when it�s the same thing?

<p>Men should be allowed to choose any hair length, same as women. I have seen more that pulled their long hair into a pony tail. For years, this was the common refrain from my family and from society: They just put it up under a hat. But i have also been told that i wasn’t there type.</p>

Truth be told though, you�ll get over it.</p>
