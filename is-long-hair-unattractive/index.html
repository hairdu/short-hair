<p>The mullet was a very popular hairstyle in the ’80’s. Even women on reddit commented (in honesty) saying that it�s unattractive and unprofessional. It was so popular it became a unisex hairstyle. Even a guy in a suit with long hair back then was just a closeted hippie. That�s why the list decided to do a little research into which.</p>

<p>It takes a lot of management but it is my legacy and my family watches me take care of it and style it. It depends on the style and how it suits you, i guess. It will send the message that you care about your hygiene. I thought the person was a girl because his character had long hair. Maybe.</p>

<p>I thought the person was a girl because his character had long hair. Some guys look like this and it�s sexy as hell, but some guys just don�t have the right hair texture for it, or have a ton of baby hairs, or are just greasy lmao and it doesn�t look as good. But long hair is a great convenience.</p>

<p>I thought it was some super buff ugly girl. Here are the best and worst long hairstyles for women. Men like touching soft skin so say bye bye to the fuzz and make sure you use moisturizers and lotions to keep your skin smooth. It was worn by men, women, children. Some people can accept hair loss, while others can’t.</p>

<p>Its unattractive when men have long hair but attractive/tolerable if women have short hair. Alltimehigh 11 years ago #1. On a guy, it�s ugly. In the back, close to the nape of the neck the hair is left long. The woman’s face, hair, her and her family’s preferences, her personal style.</p>

<p>I like what long hair stands for: I find guys that drink too much really unattractive, like they’re proving something or using alcohol for confidence (or comfort). For women who had attractive faces, differences in hair length didn’t have much effect on the perception of their beauty. Here are the best and worst long hairstyles for women. After noticing that.</p>

<p>No offense to any hippies out there. I have excessively long hair (to my knees) but i have had it for 20+ years. On a guy, it�s ugly. Some people can accept hair loss, while others can’t. Men like touching soft skin so say bye bye to the fuzz and make sure you use moisturizers and lotions to keep your.</p>
