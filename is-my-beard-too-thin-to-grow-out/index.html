<p>Over time your beard will grow thicker, the hairs will grow longer. Your beard looks thick and great. My advice is grow it for 3 month. We all fall into the trap of looking too closely at our beard and only see flaws. But in real life, no one else sees the flaws.</p>

<p>Why is my beard thin? I am growing my hair out some to match my beard. By the end of week two and into week three, your hair growth will start to resemble an actual beard. So make a goal and stick with it. If you have no patience then you might be making a mistake in growing beard.</p>

<p>You seem to have enough coverage to support a longer moustache, but it could turn out thinner than you may hope. Next, peterkin says, â€œplay to your strengths. Keep that cheek line natural.
