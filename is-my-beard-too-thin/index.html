<p>You also have to be 18 to buy minoxidil. See what areas need work on your mustache and trim it then but don�t shave it. So my recommendation is simple: I have the products your recommended! We�re here to celebrate beards, not to shame those without.</p>

<p>Look as everyone is saying genetics generally take place. I personally am not a huge fan of the bald big beard look because it seems trendy. You may not have the genes that are ideal for growing a thick beard. So my recommendation is simple: Here�s a few pics for reference:</p>

<p>But in real life, no one else sees the flaws. Over time your beard will grow thicker, the hairs will grow longer. Your beard may appear thin for several reasons.

<p>My dad found out that he could grow a full beard now at the age of 66. Beware of patchy beard scams. The first picture shows the problem.

<p>Will a thin beard fill out over time? Your beard looks thick and great. Use a boar’s hair beard brush to direct longer beard hair over thinner spots.
