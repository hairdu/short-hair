According to turley, it stimulates in a way similar to rogaine, and it increases the number of dermal papilla cells in the scalp, which are responsible for regulating hair follicle formation and your hair�s growth cycle.

Apart from shaving, cysts from the ingrowing hair on the neck may be triggered by bacterial or simply staph infections. For example, when michael werner went to get his hair cut for the first time after his recovery from neck surgery, he never expected to be in pain for days afterward.
