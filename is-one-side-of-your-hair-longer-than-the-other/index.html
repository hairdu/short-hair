<p>The more important question to answer is why your hair grows thicker on one side. We are constantly shedding hair and of course it doesn�t happen evenly all over our head. For example, if your hair falls in one direction naturally, it might make one side of your hairline look taller and more receded than the other, even if the two sides are close to symmetrical. There is a big texture difference too.</p>

For example, if your hair falls in one direction naturally, it might make one side of your hairline look taller and more receded than the other, even if the two sides are close to symmetrical.

If you have hair on one side of the head that appears to grow longer, faster, stronger, or thicker, it may be a matter of normal variance. My hair grows longer on one side as well.</p>

<p>Why is one side of my hair longer than the other. The two options for beard hair growing longer on one side over the other is to cut the hair on the long side to match the shorter side in order to balance the beard or you need to wait for the short side to catch up then trim it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it may be a matter of external influences. If you have a dad or elder brother who complains about his hair growing faster on one side, chances are you would have similar complaints. Ok, now that you’re aware that mother nature (and sometimes even genetics) is a significant part of the reason why one side of.</p>

<p>One side of my hair has bigger, looser curls and the other (the one that grows faster) has smaller, tighter curls. The hair on the left side of my head is also fuller, which corresponds with my body in general. The back of the hair is a simple layered bob. Most people completely ignore the fact that all individual things.</p>

<p>It�s not really one side over the other, but it�s like hair on the left side and the right side of my head grows faster than the hair in the back/middle of my head!!! This is not an uncommon situation. This all comes back to genetics. And since i always did the right side of my hair and then the.</p>

<p>It looks like i had an angled bob done, but i didn�t! If you have hair on one side of the head that appears to grow longer, faster, stronger, or thicker, it may be a matter of normal variance. Or why one side of your hair is thicker than the other? Middle part hairstyle korean, simple slicked back korean hairstyle;.</p>

<p>No matter how many times my hair is evened up, one side just grows faster, longer. For example, if your hair falls in one direction naturally, it might make one side of your hairline look taller and more receded than the other, even if the two sides are close to symmetrical. It doesn�t look bad, but there is a noticeable.</p>

<p>In other words, the sides of your korean fringe will be longer than the middle part and will frame your face. Maybe for some reason you put more product on one side than the other. Put simply it is when one side of your hair or one section of your hair is growing at a slower pace than the other..</p>
