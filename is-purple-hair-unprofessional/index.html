<p>For the longest time, i have always wanted to test out purple hair. Mothers can have shaved purple hair or older adults can have red. Now, if eg wants to be a marketing consultant or a lawyer like her mommy, purple hair might not be the best choice professionally.

<p>Employee came in with blue, green, and purple hair. You aren�t at school or college any more you are.
