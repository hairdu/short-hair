<p>Personally as a black woman i would not have much of a problem if white people braided their hair in cornrows/box braids. However, you should be culturally sensitive as to where it came from.

<p>Some donï¿½t deem natural hair as professional, when it comes to poc. In south korea, there are plenty of people trying box braids or dreadlocks, but they barely discuss the issue of cultural appropriation.
