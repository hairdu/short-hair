<p>Run your fingers over your stubble to determine the direction your hair is growing. Once your hairs are short and hydrated, you can take a pass in the opposite direction. If all your hair is pointing up, then shave in an upward motion. You have to decide the direction of the growth of your facial hair and then start shaving..</p>

Your skin can have natural bumps,.</p>

<p>For preventing razor bumps and possibly cutting yourself and causing even more problems. And even more important is the direction of shaving, shaving against the grain is important. What’s most important, however, is that you follow a routine that softens your hair before shaving. If it feels smooth and soft then you’re moving with the growth, or grain. If you.</p>

<p>There is no set rule on how long you should wait to shave your chest. Shaving against the grain is a great way to achieve a closer and faster shave. The pros… it’s easy, it removes excess oil and dead skin cells (which can brighten skin), it can be done daily, and it may even make your makeup last longer..</p>

<p>Simply rub your hand or a credit card across your face to roughly map the hair growth direction. Should i shave different parts of the body in different ways? Shaving your beard more often does not stimulate beard growth. First, understand that the vast majority of the facial hair grows differently in different areas. There is no set rule on.</p>
