Updos for Long Hair 50 Absolutely Stunning Ideas and Ways From mynewhairstyles.net</p>
<p>Sleeping with hair extensions in at night is perfectly safe, comfortable and not something you should worry about. I have long thick brown hair and i don’t see any breakage. This will reduce friction on your hair while sleeping, especially since you�ll have to wrap or cover your hair, and you will. The truth is, you should never sleep with your hair in a ponytail as it can cause serious damage and breakage.</p>
<h3 id="when-you-wear-your-hair-down-at-night-and-you-move-around-it-can-get-tangled-and-its-not-protected">When you wear your hair down at night and you move around, it can get tangled and it’s not protected.</h3><p>Beyond the fact that wrapping your braids at night can help maintain their freshness, you will be protecting the fragile hair around your hairline and edges, maintaining moisture for your scalp and roots, preventing hair breakage and having fresh edges by the morning. Spray reassuringly firm session hold hairspray into your hands and pull hair back into a high ponytail and secure with a band. Wearing a silk hair cap can protect your hair overnight, prevent tangling of hair, and reduce friction between the hair strands and pillowcase. I put my hair in a turban and do all that too. Use a scrunchie loosely instead of a traditional pony tail holder, and you won’t get indents in your hair. While this hair hack wasn’t too far off, it didn’t work so well because the gel would weigh my strands down.</p>

<p>While this hair hack wasn’t too far off, it didn’t work so well because the gel would weigh my strands down.

Yes, these.</p>

<p>Sleeping your hair in a “pineapple”, or loose ponytail or bun on top of your head at night, will keep your head from smashing your waves while you sleep. To do a neat ponytail, first brush your hair, then gather it at the back of your head wherever you want the ponytail and secure it with an elastic. Fun this.</p>
