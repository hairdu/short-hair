<p>You may have seen pictures of julianne hough perm after her olaplex perm it helped her achieve a beachier curl on her highlighted hair! The perm process for straight or wavy hair is a completely different process from that used on afro hair, and to gain great curl definition from a curly perm on 4c hair you need to understand.</p>

<p>And, as the name implies, you will have permanently curly hair, until it grows out. A short hair perm is a great way to amp up the natural volume in your hair. While perms are considered a permanent hair treatment, the curl pattern created actually lasts anywhere from a few months to a year—not forever. Unlike hair dyes, perms can�t.</p>

<p>When people go for a perm, they don’t realize that getting a perm alters your hair length significantly. So….if that’s enough curl for you then wait on the perm. For example, if you already have curly hair, but on the top on one side your hair tends to be straighter, a spot per can be done there to create curl.</p>

<p>A spot perm is one where rods are strategically placed to encourage curl in certain areas of the hair. If you are hoping to get a perm in order to avoid all of the common curly hair concerns you have now, like styling, moisturizing and detangling, then i urge you to think twice. Deep brown show off your curls with.</p>

<p>The chemical used to create curls contains peroxide, which can subtly lighten hair. If you have natural curly, thin hair, you can relax them with perms. There are varying degrees of relaxers available. If the stylist says wait 24 hrs i would wait to wash your hair.shower but don�t do your hair…yes as long as you don�t brush it and.</p>

<p>If you want curls that. Because of this, you should wait until after your perm has settled—usually at least 48 hours—before highlighting or coloring your hair. Finding the right length when dealing with perms can be tricky, but as a general rule of thumb, you should always anticipate about half an inch of shrinkage. A spiral perm is best on.</p>

<p>For example, if you already have curly hair, but on the top on one side your hair tends to be straighter, a spot per can be done there to create curl in that area so it matches the rest of the hair texture. Does your hair grow with a perm? Lovers of the tight curl are already flocking to hair.</p>

<p>Traditional perms involve the use of perm rods to make your hair curly, but in perms today, other tools like fabric, hair rollers, or finger waves are also used, depending on the curl shape or wave you want. I think your hair is healthy enough, but like always please schedule a consultation with a reputable stylist first! If you want.</p>
