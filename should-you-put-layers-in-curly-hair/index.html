<p>Layers can help natural hair achieve the volume and texture that you�re hoping for. Curly hair should be trimmed often. When you add layers to curly hair, it will remove a lot of the weight from the length. It’s a styling choice that’s totally negotiable.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-massage-certain-home-remedies-and-nourishing-oils-into-the-roots">You can massage certain home remedies and nourishing oils into the roots.</h3><p>Get them wrong and you’re looking at, well, you know! The problem was not layering your hair. If you have a curly mane that’s hard to tame, you can embrace its nature and go wild with a layered bob and bangs. This type of cut really can make your curly tresses easier to handle, with more versatility in your hairstyles. The amount of layers will depend on how thick or curly your hair is, but gently framing your face is flattering. If you want to highlight your cheekbones, the shortest layers should either hit or curve right at the cheekbone.</p>

<p>If you want to keep your hair long and curly, layers will remove some of the excess weight from the hair and keep curls bouncier and more defined.
