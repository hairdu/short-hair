<p>Some drugs cause hair loss, others cause little to no hair loss whatsoever. Chemotherapy may result in hair loss over your entire body, not just your scalp. On the other hand, the strong chemotherapy used to attack cancer cells can cause total hair loss. You may experience nausea (feeling like you might throw up) and vomiting (throwing up) after your.</p>

<p>Like chemotherapy treatments, radiation therapy is meant to destroy cancerous cells, but it can also impact other healthy cells and structures in your body, like your hair follicles. Hair loss varies as to its timing and extent. In fact, since hair growth is often slower after chemotherapy, increased pigment may be picked up and your hair may then grow in.</p>

<p>I guess even chemo was no match for my forest of latina forearms. But some of us, among the various effects of constipation, diarrhea, appetite loss, fertility treatments, and so on, must also deal with the very visible and very recognizable aspect of our illness — the loss of our hair. These can include nausea, bone pain, fatigue, mouth sores,.</p>

<p>In most cases, hair grows back on the scalp with the right care and treatments. Some people gradually lose hair, while others immediately begin to lose hair in large quantities. I woke up a couple of days later and i couldn’t bear the itch any longer. In all honesty i’m so scared of losing my hair and what i will.</p>

<p>The mix you will receive depends on the type of cancer you have. Some targeted therapies may also affect the pigmentation of hair, often causing the hair to become darker. It depends on the type of chemotherapy drug you are taking and how often you take it whether you will experience side effects. In fact, since hair growth is often.</p>

<p>If your doctor has told you to expect hair loss, this is what usually happens: Some chemo treatments do not make people’s hair fall out but it does become thinner or duller. Your eyelashes, eyebrows, armpits and pubic area may also be affected. Some drugs cause hair loss, others cause little to no hair loss whatsoever. It should go away.</p>
