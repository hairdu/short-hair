<p>Lesson summary william faulkner�s 1930 short story ��a rose for emily�� features. The grey hair on the pillow indicates, at least in the sheltered world of miss emily�s house, a sense of normalcy that is outside of the realm that most of us consider normal.

<p>What is significant about the gray hair at the end of the short story? A few years after homer �disappears� and her last chance to wed has gone, her hair turns gray, signifying the death of her sexuality.

<p>The story never manifests an actual rose for emily. That the hair is gray suggests that she has been lying there with the corpse for many years, up until her death. Emily too disappears for some time, and when we see her again, faulkner effectively uses the color gray to describe her:when we next saw miss emily, she had grown.</p>
