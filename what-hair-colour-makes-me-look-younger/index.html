Hair colors that make you look younger From slideshare.net</p>
<p>Jeff stump, owner of artkiteks salon points out that in additon to making you look older, dark colors show gray or white roots much faster than a more subtle color. Too much of a reddish orange undertone in your hair can make it look dull and damaged—the typical signs of aging hair, says celebrity hairstylist gabriel samra.

<h3 id="if-you-have-gray-hair-chances-are-you039re-looking-for-a-hairstyle-to-make-you-look-younger">If you have gray hair, chances are you�re looking for a hairstyle to make you look younger.</h3><p>The loss of pigment as we age also causes gray hair, and it may appear sooner than you�d expect.

Environmental damage can occur from exposure to uv rays in sunlight, dry air, harsh winds, and other elements. To make colors work for you, use color analysis to find which are the right colors for you.</p>
