They are distinct from other epidermal cells. Most hair of the human trunk and limbs is probably best interpreted as vestigial, with little present function. Stoma is a minute pore surrounded by two guard cells. Guard cells use osmotic pressure to open and close stomata, allowing plants to regulate the amount of water and solutes within them. An open stoma facilitates the process of photosynthesis in.</p>
