They are distinct from other epidermal cells. Most hair of the human trunk and limbs is probably best interpreted as vestigial, with little present function. Stoma is a minute pore surrounded by two guard cells. Guard cells use osmotic pressure to open and close stomata, allowing plants to regulate the amount of water and solutes within them.
