<h3 id="this-will-also-make-curls-have-the-same-definition-on-all-sides-even-if-you-prefer-sleeping-on-one-side">This will also make curls have the same definition on all sides, even if you prefer sleeping on one side.</h3><p>He said it�s because as you sleep the hair rubs against your sheets/pillow and it leads to breakage, frizz, and tangling.
