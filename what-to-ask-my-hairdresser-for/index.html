<p>Could anyone tell me how can i ask my hairdresser for this hairstyle? You should also ask the right questions during your appointments with your hairdresser. What i mean by that is a salon owner (whether hairdresser or not) is key, as this is how the salon is run. Be clear about what you like. Explain to the manager what.</p>
