<p>It came out that curly hair gene is dominant and straight hair gene is recessive. As mentioned earlier, curly hair is an autosomal dominant trait, which means that one of the parents has straight hair, while the other has curly hair. Thus, if you end up with curly hair, you should get the best shampoo for curly hair if it�s the case you have curly hair. Click to read full answer.</p>

Finally, two straight alleles (ss) will give you straight hair. Same for the genes which control eye color and hair color: Hair type is an interesting case of something called incomplete dominance. Is curly hair autosomal dominant? Scientists know that our genes control hair shape.</p>

<p>In order to have a trait that is expressed by a recessive gene, such as blue eyes, you must get the gene for blue eyes from both of your parents. Same for the genes which control eye color and hair color: People of european descent have 45% straight hair, 40% wavy, and 15% naturally curly hair. If you have one.</p>

<p>But there are cases where two curly haired parents can produce a child with straight or wavy hair. “curly hair is drier than straight hair because the natural oils produced by our scalp can’t travel as easily down the hair shaft like on straight hair,” explains moodie. People of european descent have 45% straight hair, 40% wavy, and 15% naturally.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, curly hair is an autosomal dominant trait, which means that one of the parents has straight hair, while the other has curly hair. So for hair type, cc gives curly, cs gives wavy and ss gives straight hair. If you have two curly alleles (cc), you’ll have curly hair. Baldness is a dominant trait. Can two parents.</p>

<p>Click to see full answer. Notice that some of the s�s these parents have happen to be in the stronger genes. Freckles, cleft chin and dimples are all examples of a dominant trait. The hair texture gene you have can explain why you can’t get the straight and full locks you’ve always desired or why your hair simply won’t stay.</p>

<p>If by chance these parents were to pass on all of their s�s to their daughter, then she would have straighter hair. You might remember the word recessive from biology, where it most often appears. The same is true for someone with straight hair who wants a chemical perm or who has to curl her hair every morning. Scientists know.</p>

<p>You might remember the word recessive from biology, where it most often appears. Hair type is an interesting case of something called incomplete dominance. In fact, they may only need to pass the s version of the more powerful hair texture genes to have such a big effect. Interestingly, the curly hair gene is the dominant gene when it comes.</p>

<p>It turns out that whether you have straight or curly hair is associated with the same edar gene, a gene that also influences eyebrow thickness.

<p>Curly hair tends to be much drier than straight hair because it is easier for the oils secreted from the scalp to travel down the shaft of a straight hair than a curly one (this is why curly hair often turns into frizzy hair). A recessive gene is a gene that can be masked by a dominant gene. The gene.</p>

<p>I read an explanation that curly hair gene is dominant and the reason could be that humans evolved in african continent and curly hair kept the head cooler compared to straight hair. The trait for curly hair (which is the normal for humans) follows the same rules, two damaged or recessive allele’s of the tchh gene means straight hair. Freckles,.</p>

<p>Dark hair is dominant over blonde or red hair. Type 3 is curly hair that looks like the letters s or z. People of european descent have 45% straight hair, 40% wavy, and 15% naturally curly hair.
