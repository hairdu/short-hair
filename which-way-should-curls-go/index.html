<p>Curly, textured, coily, kinky, the list goes on and on. The stylist will cut the hair curl by curl paying close attention to your curl pattern on how your hair falls.

<p>In this case performing light barbell bicep curls prior to your heavy sets is needed.

<p>Meaning only one joint should be moving. I wouldn�t see any reason not to. Wash your hair once every 2 or 3 days. When curly hair is cut short, the cuts should be made with the natural curl rather than against it. This will allow you to set your style quickly.</p>

<p>To get your curls to tuck under you must hold your hand on the outside of your hair and brush from the underneath, twisting the brush to encourage the curl to curl under with the motion.

<p>Sometimes i also cup my hands and fill them with water to scrunch water into my curls, either way the key is to use water to your advantage.
