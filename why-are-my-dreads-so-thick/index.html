<p>You know you�ve reached the mature stage when your locs are finally long enough to lie flat or hang down. The thicker the dreadlocks the further it must weave back and forth across the dread and the slower the dreads will gain length. Hair texture, age, and products used on locs play a huge role in determining the possibility of detangling. A single dreadlock is formed by a section of hair tangling along.</p>

A single dreadlock is formed by a section of hair tangling along. Amidi explains that physics has made great strides in explaining the nature of time measurement. But don’t start too thin!

<p>Hair is always breaking and retangling and regrowing, and you don’t want your dreads to be so thin. Vitamin a is a vital nutrient needed by all cells in the body to grow, including the hair.

<p>Hair texture, age, and products used on locs play a huge role in determining the possibility of detangling. Why i cut off my dreads of 10 years.
