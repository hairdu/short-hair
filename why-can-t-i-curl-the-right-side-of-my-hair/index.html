<p>Mine does this also after i blow it dry, but my old hairdresser said it was b/c i am right handed. It definitely curls better now, but it�s totally uneven. Again, these are brushed out waves. My right side curls perfectly, they clump together into perfect ringlets, but the left side just ends up stringy and wavy and looks messy.</p>
<h3 id="the-ridged-side-creates-a-look-that-isnt-as-defined-but-it-also-shows-less-of-your-scalp">The ridged side creates a look that isn’t as defined, but it also shows less of your scalp.</h3><p>And skip conditioner — which weighs down hair, making it harder to stay curly — if you can. The right side of my head is super curly and the left side is completely straight!! Also, the right side is way curlier, healthier and looks better. I think i have the worst problem here. I’ve had straight, thick hair all my life until. If your hair is not fully saturated with water when you apply your products, they will be unevenly distributed so that some sections of hair will curl, and others will fall flat, not clump, or frizz.</p>
