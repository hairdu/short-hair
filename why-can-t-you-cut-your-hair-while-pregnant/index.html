<p>If a woman’s hair is cut while she is pregnant, the baby could develop problems with its vision. If you get a perm or hair relaxer, you might be surprised at the results. The good news is that whatever you chose to do is acceptable. And thus, cutting it off may make your hair look better. If you�re going to.</p>

<p>The chemicals used are only absorbed by your hair, and not by your scalp or bloodstream. While there are a few methods of hair removal that are safe to follow, the best way to remove pubic hair during pregnancy is to trim it as short as possible, rather than to remove it completely as this keeps the area clean, allows.</p>

<p>Yes, you can dye your hair while you�re pregnant — as long as you take certain precautions and mention your pregnancy to your stylist. Pregnancy can affect your hair’s normal condition.
