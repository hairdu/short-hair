<p>As soon as i hit the bed, one side of my face is pressed close against the pillow. If you have hair on one side of the head that appears to grow longer, faster, stronger, or thicker, it may be a matter of normal variance. The hair on your head is not an exception to that. You might have thicker.</p>

<p>Your armpits arenât connected, so one can sometimes grow more than the other. Body odor has to do with the way bacteria on your skin metabolizes sweat. It is accompanied by uncomfortable skin rashes that tend to affect only on one side of the body, usually on the face, chest, back or arms. The blood supply may be slightly asymmetrical,.</p>

<p>So i donât think that this is odd that you have foul smell only under one armpit and the other one is fine. This is just how your body has developed. One theory, according to jaime schmidt, founder of schmidtâs natural deodorant, is that armpit hair wicks away sweat from the skin so that it doesnât spread across the body..</p>

<p>Folliculitis have been linked to conditions where multiple hairs emanates from one hair follicle. They range from simple skin irritation or muscle strain to autoimmune disorders, heart disease, and cancer. Sage and moringa have been known to reverse the premature graying of hair. Or consuming too much or too little iodine. For those who drive extensively, may notice that there.</p>

<p>Each hair follicle and nail has its own blood supply. One theory, according to jaime schmidt, founder of schmidtâs natural deodorant, is that armpit hair wicks away sweat from the skin so that it doesnât spread across the body. Yet there are instances in my own situation where i am more sensitive on my right side then on my left..</p>

<p>Hi, chris.this is certainly an unusual phenomenon but there are a few reasons that your hair may be thinner on one side than the other. Sometimes eating onions and garlic make it worse also. Cysts and infections on the surface of the skin of the armpit may be caused by shaving or use of antiperspirants abscesses under the skin may.</p>

<p>Pain from two hairs in one follicle. So what happens on one side of our body might not happen on the other. So, you might see hair growing more quickly on one side than the other in a family. Sleeping on the same side you may be exerting constant pressure and applying friction from your pillow if you only sleep.</p>
