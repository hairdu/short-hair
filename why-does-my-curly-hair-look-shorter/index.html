<p>That is why keeping your curly hair in a shorter hairstyle is the perfect way to keep that irresistible texture while still being manageable. Shrinkage also occurs when blown out hair absorbs moisture. Also, the length and shaping of a bob can be used to accentuate (or downplay) your features. We’ve been hearing you loud and clear!</p>
<h3 id="because-you-need-a-couple-of-pattern-repeats-to-see-the-waves-curls">Because you need a couple of pattern repeats to see the waves/ curls.</h3><p>If you’re looking to embrace your natural waves, these techniques are ones you’ll want your stylist to. I usually just do deep conditioning and oil, but i�m always looking for new products that won�t make. And you don�t have to have super tight ringlets either. I�m not sure what the reason for that is, i would guess stress has a lot to do with it too but i went to a dermatologist recently and have been taking vitamins and she recommended i use horse mane shampoo, which my hair has not been liking. I was different from my friends, i was different from the girls in the magazines, and i was even different from my own family. It is mostly shorter pixie type cuts that i think would work with my weird curls.</p>

<p>How quickly curly hair grows the fact of the matter is that curly hair takes a longer time to grow longer because it grows in a curl, rather than straight down.
