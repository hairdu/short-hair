<p>The root, and mid length of the hair is generally much thicker. Alternatively, if you went with your natural curls, you could pump up the volume with the aid of a curling iron. This way of styling would not cause the flip at your current length. If you prefer curly hair, curl the surface layer to match the texture and pattern of your curls using a curling iron.</p>
<h3 id="curly-hair-is-thought-to-be-better-at-keeping-mammals-warmer-than-just-straight-hair-alone">Curly hair is thought to be better at keeping mammals warmer than just straight hair alone.</h3><p>This is also why you don’t see your wavy hair when you have shorter hair. Your curl definition could also be suffering from improper care or product use. Not all hair does , but it will likely be because the hair becomes thinner at the ends , through wear and tear. Well i�ve been told by my hairdresser to do it all natural, shampoo, condition twice in the shower, towel dry my hair just a little, then leave it, go to bed with wet hair then i�d repeat this every 3 days, he said that this is best for your hair but now i�ve just realised, like you said, my hair is really dry, i just want my curls to be all. Curly hair is a very popular hairstyle for you when you said that my hair is straight on top and curly on bottom. The curls, along with clash due to thickness and volume, where curl’s ends pushes away.</p>

<p>Usually, when i get my hair cut i ask for them to layer it, but i kind of forgot to ask that. The ends don’t have as much weight in them as the rest of the hair , so it is prone to lifting up, or curling. What i mean by curly on bottom and straight on top is underneath.</p>
