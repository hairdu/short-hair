You have too much product in your hair Buildup is so common, it�s one.</p>

<p>This is also why you don’t see your wavy hair when you have shorter hair. You can also turn the heat too low. But also, some people find that their hair in those two spots gets curlier if they work out or that those areas get curlier the farther they get from wash day, and i think that is related.</p>

<p>This can cause it to also be the thinnest hair on your head, and make it curl the tightest. It will literally get like 3x bigger than what is in those pictures after picking it. The shaft of your hair affects how curly it is because of the way protein molecules build up. All factors that can change your haircut.</p>
