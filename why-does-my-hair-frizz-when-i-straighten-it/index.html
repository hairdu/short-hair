<p>Knowing how to treat hair with the right products after straightening it is the key avoiding frizz. Hair can be dry from damage, improperly moisturizing it, and harsh surfactants. I use revlon’s largest pro collection ionic touch round brush ($12) to straighten out my hair as i dry it. To flat iron afterwards, i apply a heat protectant (chi silk infusion or maxius products are great).</p>
<h3 id="why-is-my-straight-hair-frizzy">Why is my straight hair frizzy?</h3><p>But if you’ve got fine, thin, or straight hair, you now know the truth. Since my hair will be a bit puffy, newly dried, i use irresistible me’s diamond flat iron ($150) at 375 degrees. When the pigment stops being generated inside gray hair, the tiny oil glands attached to each individual hair also become less active, leaving hairs more dry, fragile, and prone to frizzing. Spray a detangling product into your hands. It looks frizzy and kinda puffed up after curling. You can also spray a shine or straightening serum on a flat paddle brush and run the brush over frizzy hairs to smooth them down.</p>
