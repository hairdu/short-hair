<p>Although this is somewhat common, found in many men that have shaved heads from bad hairlines etc, my case is so bad that i am in constant aches from my pinched nerve and i have been prescribed cortisone pills. This, in turn, accentuates the crooked sitting, and the saddle’s unevenness gets worse. This can cause the saddle to compress unevenly.</p>
