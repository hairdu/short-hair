Why you shouldn�t brush or comb curly hair From curlsandbeautydiary.com</p>
<p>You are turning your curling iron heat up too high. I have tried parting on the other side but my hair refuses to stay and it gets awkward. Styling hair that is dry or damaged takes extra time and can be frustrating. Styling hair that is dry or damaged takes extra time and can be frustrating.</p>
<h3 id="however-one-problem-remains-the-same">However, one problem remains the same:</h3><p>Mine does this also after i blow it dry, but my old hairdresser said it was b/c i am right handed. This trick is especially important if you’re using a curling iron with a clamp. My dad is a red head (and do am i) and you can imagine his curls, but my mom has pencil straight hair. Scalp massages increase blood circulation to your scalp, strengthen your hair’s roots and helps to evenly distribute your hair’s natural oils (so that your tresses receive more moisture as they experience less breakage)—all of this ultimately leads to a stronger head of hair, on the both sides; Dirty hair is the best hair to achieve desired results. Other people find that if they sleep on their back every night it affects how their hair curls.</p>

<p>As for the “cause” it is likely simply a matter of genetics. When i hit my 30’s, i noticed that my hair was becoming slightly lighter and my waves were obvious even when my hair was long. It�s not really one side over the other, but it�s like hair on the left side and the right side of my head.</p>

<p>With different textures on one head, some curly girls find issues that may not mirror the norm like jvvmp who inquired about hair dryness in our curly q&amp;a. I think that was the case for me because in my straightening days i used to get so tired at the end of my routine that i would get sloppy and i.</p>

<p>Dryness can cause the hair to be frizzy, resulting in a lack of curl definition, while hair damage can cause the hair to look misshapen from a lack of structure. The same thing could happen with people who have thick hairs but curl producing hair follicles, especially women who have had long hair their whole lives. I�ll try parting more.</p>

<p>Basically, i cut my hair about 3 to 4 months ago, and i just cut the damaged ends off. One of my fails, was not taking care of my hair after bleaching it. Dirty hair is the best hair to achieve desired results. The left side is barely wavy. It�s not really one side over the other, but it�s like.</p>

<p>Scalp massages increase blood circulation to your scalp, strengthen your hair’s roots and helps to evenly distribute your hair’s natural oils (so that your tresses receive more moisture as they experience less breakage)—all of this ultimately leads to a stronger head of hair, on the both sides; The same thing could happen with people who have thick hairs but curl.</p>

<p>This means that there are more hairs per square inch of scalp on the “thicker” side, and fewer on the side that “lays flatter”. My stylist said it could be because my hair is parted to the left and so the left side is heavier, does that make sense or is there something else that could cause it? Before i.</p>

<p>At first it’s just the hair around my temple would curl and then the whole top layer started to curl but there was this underneath section that stayed straight. I have a question about my hair that i cannot find the answer to anywhere online. With different textures on one head, some curly girls find issues that may not mirror.</p>

<p>My back on the right is more prone to tangles no matter what i use or do, it will tangle up like a demon. At first it’s just the hair around my temple would curl and then the whole top layer started to curl but there was this underneath section that stayed straight. This means that there are more hairs.</p>

<p>I have tried parting on the other side but my hair refuses to stay and it gets awkward. It will flick more on the side the crown is not on, weirdly. I think that was the case for me because in my straightening days i used to get so tired at the end of my routine that i would get.</p>
