So, my question is, why does the bottom of all my hairs.</p>

<p>Left side stays super straight but my right side always flips out no matter what. Your hair might start to feel dry, coarse and brittle if you use a lot of heat on your hair.

<p>Alternatively if you went with your natural curls you could pump up the volume with the aid of a curling iron. We see tons of people on curly q&amp;a asking why their hair completely changed curl pattern after a cut. Length also does not seem to be a factor as shorter hairs exibit the same behavior.

<p>I�ve been trying to take good care of my hair for about 4 months now after having heat and bleach damage cut out and i�ve pretty much stopped using heat, but i do dye black now, instead of bleaching. My hair does the same thing so i feel your pain. So, my question is, why does the bottom of all.</p>

<p>I�ve thought about doing japanese hair straightening but i also dye my hair and i�ve always heard you shouldn�t do both. Oval follicle shapes produce curly hair while round follicles produce straight hair. Unfortunately, the list can go on forever. Do i curl my hair inwards or outwards?

<p>When your shoulder line (or neckline) is perpendicular to your hair, you’ll notice that your hair will curl outward because the ends of your hair touched your shoulders.
