<p>Left side stays super straight but my right side always flips out no matter what. I don�t recall it happening with my endura shorts (which, admittedly, are a bit thicker). Flyaways (aka those short hairs that stick up) are very annoying when you�ve put so much work into styling your mane to look smooth and luxurious. So hey, they�re not all bad.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-my-hair-stick-up-when-cutting-short-">Why does my hair stick up when cutting short ?</h3><p>During the interval from when the hair is a few millimeters long to when the hair is a few centimeters long, the hair sticks out and refuses to lie flat against the side of the head. It also could be because of the way you take care of your hair. I used to have very short hair too and had the same issue. You can use a straightener or you can wet your hair and blowdry the hair down with hot air then after its almost dry, change it to cool. #thesalonguy #hairtutorial #hairtipswhy does your hair stick up?

<p>I had never used so much product and so many bobby pins in my life.
