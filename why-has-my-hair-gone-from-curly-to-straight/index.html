<p>The part that�s getting straight is mostly just the top of my head and the rest is 3a curls. Most hair does not change drastically, although it has been known to happen.

<p>But my hair is both straight and curly, with a little bit of wave here and there. Oh, we had the normal cycles of hair fashion leaning towards curly, when mom would sit me on a phone book and give me a tony home perm, but for the most part, it was straight and i grew up practicing my hair.</p>

<p>During this past year and a bit, my hair started to become very frizzy and unruly and didn’t respond to my old way of styling with blow drying or a hot brush. I end up with a giant frizzy mess. The rest of my hair is wavy. There are some other possibilities, though! You cut the curls off.</p>
