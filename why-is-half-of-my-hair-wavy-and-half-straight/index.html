<p>There could be a number of things that causes your hair to look like that. Why is my hair curly when wet but frizzy when dry? Most likely your hair is dry and damaged on the outer layers. Another cause of changing hormones is menopause.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-recommend-you-to-do-is-divide-your-hair-in-sections-like-at-least-4-sections-and-braid-it">What i recommend you to do is divide your hair in sections like at least 4 sections and braid it.</h3><p>Theres a possibility that the straighter hair on top is damaged by heat and exposure to the elements in which case i would recommend deep conditioning to add moisture back to your hair. There could be a number of things that causes your hair to look like that. If you use/used heat or got a relaxer/perm, then there could be a possibility that it is damaged. For example, the oval face, you can cut the bob hairstyle and combine a little bending curl lightly on the tail to create a highlight for the face. Aging affects the hair follicles, but it is rarely a cause of curly hair. Most likely your hair is dry and damaged on the outer layers.</p>

<p>Hair that is wavy when wet but dries straight is naturally wavy hair that is being weighed down or stretched out. Never sleeping with my bonnet on again bro wtf is this.

<p>Often wavy hair needs support from gel or mousse to maintain its texture as it dries. Moreover, your haircut can be too short. However, aging does make hair strands finer. While hair is still damp, apply a curling mousse and gently work thru your hair using your fingers or a hair pick. You have straight or slightly wavy hair.</p>
