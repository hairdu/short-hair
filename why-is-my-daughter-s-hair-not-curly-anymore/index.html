<p>I followed the instructions and waited 72 hours before shampooing my hair. A great way to treat these follicles and bring back curly hair is to indulge in deep conditioning treatments, as they provide intense hydration to the hair. Repeated use of a straightening iron. Why does my hair not hold curl anymore?</p>
<h3 id="the-curl-in-girls039-hair-often-goes-away-when-the-hair-follicles-are-damaged">The curl in girls� hair often goes away when the hair follicles are damaged.</h3><p>If your hair is constantly dry your strands will snap and break off. It could also be the result of build up or using heavy products. And i’m expected to “deep treat” my hair at least once a week (but i don’t), while for other types of hair, washing daily may be hair. This trick is especially important if you’re using a curling iron with a clamp. The hairdresser and i both agreed that it was going to be just wavy, but not very curly. Growing up i was told my hair needed to be controlled at all times.</p>
