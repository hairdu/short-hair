<p>By far the most common reason for a cat to have hair loss in these areas is from overgrooming. Fleas are one of the most common reasons to see hind leg hair loss in cats. Hair loss in cats due to stress may be due to a disorder known as telogen effluvium. While some people mistakenly assume the cat develops this excess flesh as a result of being spayed or neutered, it’s actually a normal part of your cat’s anatomy.</p>
<h3 id="apparently-she-is-very-sensitive-or-even-allergic-to-fleas">Apparently she is very sensitive, or even allergic, to fleas.</h3><p>We usually attribute overgrooming to stress but it. It’s most common in female purebreds with nervous personalities. Anything that causes a cat to feel itchy is a potential cause for the hair loss, in response to a cat licking to alleviate the itch. In these cases, the hair loss is not caused by excessive licking, but due to a molting disorder. It typically leads to loss of hair around the underbelly, base of the tail, feet and face. Parasites that bring about mange, and fungal issues like ringworm, are also common causes of cat alopecia, especially in younger cats or those with other health issues.</p>
