But the harsh rays can cause your hair to become weak, dry and brittle, from the cuticle and even down to the cortex (middle of the.</p>

<p>Just a thought, a lot of the time the “frizz” that people with fine hair get is because of static rather than dryness. Why is my hair always dry and frizzy ? You may not want to lose the length, but it will be worth it to give you. I second all of this. It will just linger on top.</p>

<p>Apart from using a nourishing conditioner each time that you wash your hair, applying a hair mask or treatment once a week or so will coat and fill any holes in the hair shaft.
