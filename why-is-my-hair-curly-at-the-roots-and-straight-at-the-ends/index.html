The roots are getting pulled straight by the weight of your hair, whereas the ends are free to curl to their heart�s desire. The roots are getting pulled straight by the weight of your hair, whereas the ends are free to curl to their heart�s desire.</p>
<h3 id="using-heat-tools-in-extreme-temperature-settings-is-one-of-the-fastest-ways-of-losing-curls">Using heat tools in extreme temperature settings is one of the fastest ways of losing curls.</h3><p>The underlayer of my hair has some spiral curls but my hair was never this curly at the roots. In this case, too much weight causes the curl to. People frequently notice their oily roots and their dry and patchy ends when their top hair layer is straight and their roots are curly. Curls need moisture, and not too much handling to maintain their curliness. If you like curly hair use curling iron to curl the top layer to match the rest of your curls, and if you like straight hair, leave the top layer and straighten the curly hair. The roots are getting pulled straight by the weight of your hair, whereas the ends are free to curl to their heart�s desire.</p>
