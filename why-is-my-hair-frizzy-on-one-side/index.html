How to Figure Out Your Curl Type and Why It Actually Helps From pinterest.com</p>
<p>A previous stylist used a razor blade on the underneath part of my hair, and now that it�s been cut and layered (by someone who knows how to cut curly hair), it is a little more noticeable, but just in that one area. I suggest doing the same, but in the morning before school, with water and gel. Hair in the top layer is more likely to be frizzy because it is the most exposed hair part to pollution, sunlight, humidity, and friction when we sleep. Hair in the top layer is more likely to be frizzy because it is the most exposed hair part to pollution, sunlight, humidity, and friction when we sleep.</p>

I have tried so many products claiming to tame the frizz but nothing works. Ion hair dryers are designed to put dry heat to hair, not recirculate potentially humid air. The problem is that these areas absorb water differently, so they don’t swell the same. Those straight hairs fall to each side (right and left) and cover my curly hair. Sometimes there is redness, scaling, itchiness, hair loss, and sometimes not.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you tie your hair up, the hair which the hairband is tight on can cause spilt ends and friction!

<p>Also, my hair is extremely curly underneath, and i think that causes frizz because it doesn�t separate well, if that makes sense.

<p>Hair that is damaged tends to have a dry, rough and frizzy appearance compaired to undamaged hair, this is because the “scales” that make up the surface of the hairs have lifted, allowing moisture to be lost much faster.

<p>It sounds like heat damage, if you�re trying to heal that damage then i would definitely recommend air drying your hair rather than using a blow dryer, and then don�t use any straighteners or curling irons on your hair.

<p>Does the frizzy come after hair is dried naturally ? :d hope this helps !!!! Do you hold the dryer closer on thst side. I can�t cut the top of my hair short in layers cuz. One part may absorb a lot of moisure and swell a lot, while the other stays relatively the same.</p>

<p>Is the heating control really hot or cool ? Sometimes when you tie your hair up, the hair which the hairband is tight on can cause spilt ends and friction!
