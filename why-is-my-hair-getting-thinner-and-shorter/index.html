In other cases, thinning hair is triggered by something going on inside the body — for instance, a thyroid problem, a shift in hormones, a recent pregnancy, or an inflammatory condition.hair loss may also be genetic. I think it is.</p>

<p>When my hair got thin i started buzzing it shorter and shorter. One large investment will save money and time in the long run. Even though it seems counterproductive, it will help in the long run. Lack of sleep leads to stress which will shock your hair cycle. Hair follicles start to shrink, producing shorter and finer hairs than they.</p>

<p>Hair follicles start to shrink, producing shorter and finer hairs than they used to before they stop producing hairs at all. The more curly our hair, the tighter and shorter the curls. Giving your preferred styling side a break can give your hair follicles time to strengthen so that that side of your hair can appear stronger and thicker again..</p>
