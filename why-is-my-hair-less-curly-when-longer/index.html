Why does my hair always look the best when I’m about to go From reddit.com</p>
<p>And i must say , it is one of the most well written and explained blog. How my hair looked when wet was another sign that it was naturally wavy, not straight. Every time you look in the mirror, you should feel elevated because your hair looks incredible, but alas, all you see is hair that disheartens you and makes you think ”why my hair is dull and lifeless”.every 8 out of 10 women are concerned about their hair problems and search for every possible reason to make them better. This is typically experienced by those with looser curl patterns where removing length results in the removal of ringlets, making your curls appear looser.</p>
<h3 id="the-water-that-is-still-in-the-hair-after-the-shower-encourages-the-curl-to-appear">The water that is still in the hair after the shower encourages the curl to appear.</h3><p>Repeated use of a straightening iron. The combination of using a comb and the moisture evaporating straightens the hair. Even years of using products with sulfates can wreak havoc on naturally curly hair. Its my desire to have long curly hair like you (type iii). I vividly remember spending many days looking in the mirror and cursing myself for having this wild and uncontrollable hair. I have silky straight hair when it is short and type i curly hair when it is long.</p>

<p>If you’ve had long hair in the past twenty years or so, there’s a high chance you have chemical or heat damage.

<p>My journey to embracing my natural texture and natural curl pattern has not been an easy or a short road. This is typically experienced by those with looser curl patterns where removing length results in the removal of ringlets, making your curls appear looser. Cutting a curl in the middle of its loop will make it. Which is a problem.</p>

<p>Pollution has been linked to hair loss in some studies. Loosen the matted strands by saturating hair with a good detangler, oil, or moisturizing conditioner but never a shampoo and water only.

<p>When it comes to curly hair, the sooner you can set your curls the better, which is why it’s recommended you apply styling products while your hair is still very damp and before your frizz has time to set in.

<p>There are no studies linking curly hair to pollution. Most of it is lightly wavy. How my hair looked when wet was another sign that it was naturally wavy, not straight. My hair has dandruff as well. Every time you look in the mirror, you should feel elevated because your hair looks incredible, but alas, all you see is hair.</p>

<p>Just as differences in coarseness matter, the additional curl is a big deal when you�re learning how to manage your pubic hair. Having hair that looks straight but is poofy is one sign of having wavy hair or curly hair. My hair has dandruff as well. Wavy hair which is not too long, not too short, could be especially suitable.</p>

<p>The shaft of your hair affects how curly it is because of the way protein molecules build up. Where on your strands the stylist snips can also make a difference. Proteins such as keratins tend to build up unevenly in curly hair, collecting in the curve of your hair, make it curl even more. Sure, they can be wild and.</p>

<p>Even years of using products with sulfates can wreak havoc on naturally curly hair. Every seven to 10 years, my hair tends to change texture. Scientists don�t know exactly why this happens, but it probably has to do with a combination of genetics, hormones and body chemistry. Curls generally need a little extra love, and it�s.

<p>The hair follicle will more. Men with curly hair “curly hair is curly because the follicle that it grows from under the scalp is not straight,” says celebrity hairdresser and trichologist guy parsons.

<p>Curly hair is a bit more delicate than straight hair, and the tighter the curl or coil, the more fragile the strand. My journey to embracing my natural texture and natural curl pattern has not been an easy or a short road. The combination of using a comb and the moisture evaporating straightens the hair. It’s common in some areas.</p>
