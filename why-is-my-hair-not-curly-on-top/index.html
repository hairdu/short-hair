<p>The bottom part of the hair, being protected better, is healthier and retain more moisture within the hair shaft, dries slower and tend to have stronger curl. I caused so much damage to my hair texture that my curls were almost nonexistent, not even a curly hair expert could tell my hair was naturally curly. His reply is what hit.</p>

<p>Honest “tips” to remember when curling straight hair: To make the top of the hair curls is to condition the hair to absorb moisture and seal in the moisture and set the hair while it is still moist and curly. Unfortunately, long hair tends to equate to heavier hair, which drags your curls down and gives the appearance of stretched.</p>

<p>Sulfates are detergents that attract dirt and oil and make it easy for shampoos to cleanse your hair. I knew my hair couldn’t curl anymore or look any better. Welcome to the /r/hair community! • the longer your top layer of hair grows, the heavier it becomes, causing it to look straighter. Another culprit of frizz is sulfates.</p>

<p>I usually just do deep conditioning and oil, but i�m always looking for. You should know that the gene which determines curly hair, is not totally dominant. I caused so much damage to my hair texture that my curls were almost nonexistent, not even a curly hair expert could tell my hair was naturally curly. It’s not enough to just.</p>

<p>Grease is often the main culprit when it comes to flat hair. The looser the curl pattern, the more you need to wash your hair. Curl shapes range from tight coils to ringlets but also irregular curl patterns. Sulfates are detergents that attract dirt and oil and make it easy for shampoos to cleanse your hair. Another culprit of frizz.</p>
