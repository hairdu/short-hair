<p>However, there are other possibilities. Dirty hair is the best hair to achieve desired results. “ if there is still moisture in the hair when you use a curling iron, it will not curl as well , and the curls will eventually drop out,” says huffnagle. I then decided to stop wearing a man bun and cut my hair every once in a while to strengthen my hair.</p>
<h3 id="when-it-comes-to-hair-our-follicles-determine-the-structure-of-our-hair">When it comes to hair, our follicles determine the structure of our hair.</h3><p>In most cases where naturally wavy hair loses its curl, the cause is a lack of protein. There are several solutions to repairing hair that will not hold color anymore. I usually direct them to the curly girl method, a special method of caring for your curls that tends to revive them over time. False lashes can cause damage by “ waxing” your natural lashes out when they are peeled abruptly after being placed incorrectly on the lash line. My hairdresser taught me to only curl dirty hair (don�t wash before curling), use extra strong hairspray on each segment before curling, on each segment after curling, and again when i�m done styling. And with that on a daily basis, it is even curlier.</p>
