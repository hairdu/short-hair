<p>When your hair is cut wet, it’s shorter than you wanted once it dries. If you fall in between straight and curly, you may feel like your only option is to straighten or curl your hair because it feels frizzy or unmanageable when you wear it naturally. Wavy hair is the mane that slightly bends as it raises from the hair hole, so, once given enough distance, wavy hair looks like waveforms. Hm, i think the problem is.you�re straightener isn�t hot enough or whereever you are;its very humid.</p>
<h3 id="i-think-the-moisture-of-my-wet-hair-paired-with-the-fact-that-it-is-so-close-to-my-face-body-heat-makes-a-sort-of-humid-hair-climate-so-the-parts-of-my-ahir-that-are-closer-to-my-head-are-more">I think the moisture of my wet hair, paired with the fact that it is so close to my face (body heat) makes a sort of humid hair climate, so the parts of my ahir that are closer to my head are more.</h3><p>If you have gray hair, you need to treat it the same as anyone born with dry, frizzy. The atandered says no wave but if my guccis hair air drys his is cottney as well. Thank you for reading this question!first of all i�m 15, but i�ve been a natural for 3 to 4 years now. I think its about the drying time and also the humidity of my head. (which yes is something your hair can do. My male has wave in his hair also.</p>

<p>Coming from a mindset of hair being treated only one of two ways can keep you from finding its true curl potential because, after all, no two curls, coils, or waves want to be treated the same. The waves also tend to create more volume than straight hair does, as more natural oils and a bit of extra fat help.</p>

<p>Hm, i think the problem is.you�re straightener isn�t hot enough or whereever you are;its very humid. (which yes is something your hair can do. The hot water causes the hair shaft to get frayed. This may be from water weighing hair down as it dries, or from hair being brushed or combed. Thick, dark, straight hair has been my luxury.</p>

<p>I am 27 years old, 5� 3 tall, and my face shape is oval (i think—or maybe rectangular). Can someone explain why the hair underneath is so wavy/curly… | but when i do the same thing on the top layer of my hair it’s way limper and…gross. The change of muscle tone could affect the shape of your hair follicles.</p>

<p>Hm, i think the problem is.you�re straightener isn�t hot enough or whereever you are;its very humid. I�ve gotten most of my hair to grow, but there is this little section on both sides of my hair that, when combed, is a giant poof!

<p>Humidity causes the hydrogen bond to break, allowing the hair to become wavy or frizzy, and the strands of hair will remain in that shape as it dries. With less natural oil, gray hair becomes dry, brittle and wiry or frizzy. He is beutiful regaurdless and my be you baby was breed by an unscrupulas breeder way back when and.</p>

<p>It is at its peak after i wash it, as my curls are moisture activated. Moisture makes the hair go right back to wavy. When your hair is cut wet, it’s shorter than you wanted once it dries. Often wavy hair needs support from gel or mousse to maintain its texture as it dries. Oh, we had the normal cycles.</p>

<p>So, wavy hair is similar to straight hair, but it tends to be curlier. Hair that is wavy when wet but dries straight is naturally wavy hair that is being weighed down or stretched out. With its natural texture, wavy hair tends to get frizzy with even a little bit of moisture in the air! For example, you might feel.</p>

<p>Wavy hair is no doubt beautiful and wonderful, but people will feel that is is a little difficult to take care of compared with straight hair. I think the moisture of my wet hair, paired with the fact that it is so close to my face (body heat) makes a sort of humid hair climate, so the parts of my.</p>

<p>My male has wave in his hair also. Often wavy hair needs support from gel or mousse to maintain its texture as it dries. And just as hormones may impact hair texture, any medications that affect hormones, such as glucocorticoids or thyroxine, could also potentially make hair become wavy or curly. I am 27 years old, 5� 3 tall, and.</p>

<p>Oh, we had the normal cycles of hair fashion leaning towards curly, when mom would sit me on a phone book and give me a tony home perm, but for the most part, it was straight and i grew up practicing my hair styles with straight hair. The waves also tend to create more volume than straight hair does, as.</p>

<p>If your wavy hair tends to be on the straight side, your hair may lack volume. This may be from water weighing hair down as it dries, or from hair being brushed or combed. Moisture makes the hair go right back to wavy. A happy medium between straight and curly hair, it’s the perfect way to flaunt a bit of.</p>
