<p>I discovered straighteners, curlers and hairdryers when i was 15 years old. Heat abuse, since the age of 15! Treatment can prevent hair loss from worsening and help women regrow their hair.

When women style their hair into tight ponytails and buns, they put undue physical stress on the hair follicles, straining the hair at the temples and leading.</p>

<p>The first place i noticed was my nape, and then as the months went by it got worse and worse around my temples, ears, sides to ththe point where i could not wear my hair down, and then eventually couldn’t tie it back because it looked moth eaten and freakish.

<p>Both men and women can experience hair loss on their temples as a result of genetic or behavioral factors. This type of hair loss is hereditary and is related to the male hormones. The temporal side, the area around ears, and back of. Check out my post here for some options that may help with thinning hair, but often times.</p>

<p>The pattern of the thinning in this case is based on what hair follicles die off. Given how precious hair is, especially to the female gender, hair thinning at the temples can be disheartening as it leads to hair loss.
