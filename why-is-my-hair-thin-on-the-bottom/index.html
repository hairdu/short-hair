Why is my hair thinning in the front, From alqurumresort.com</p>
<p>The hairdresser has left my hair thin and short, just below my shoulders and light. The top layer of hair barely loses any length, and layers are basically hidden. Hair thinning is a common effect of this kind of hair loss, but it’s temporary. The hair loss begins above the temples and continues around the perimeter and top of the head to create a ring of hair along the bottom of the scalp.</p>
<h3 id="the-bottom-layers-of-hair-are-gently-layered">The bottom layers of hair are gently layered.</h3><p>Regrettably, we just don’t talk about it. Why this part of your hair always gets more damaged than others. We often associate hair loss with men. But as those who’ve gone the platinum route can attest, the double processing does change the texture of your hair. Cutting long, soft layers like these cuts would help rectify this, exposing the healthy hair underneath: Your hair tips are not as strong as your hair roots.</p>
