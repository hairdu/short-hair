It is a progressive condition.</p>

<p>In general, thinning hair occurs partially. An uneven hairline is a hairline that’s noticeably different on one side than it is on the other.

<p>Now i�ve noticed the hair on my left eyebrow is falling out (or is thinner anyway) on the outer edge, but the right side seems normal. I�m 22 and the hair on my temples has been receding for a while. Hair loss on the scalp and beard area could be alopecia areata, a condition where the immune system attacks hair.</p>

<p>If hair is falling out in just one place, then it is much less likely that it is related to an underlying medical problem like iron deficiency or thyroid problems. I�ve never plucked my eyebrows, and they�ve always been a little on the bushy side, but now the left one is really thin on the outer side. Though people can.</p>
