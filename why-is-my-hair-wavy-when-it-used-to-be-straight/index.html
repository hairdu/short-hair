Brushing wavy hair doesn’t fix frizz. My first two [kids] had very straight hair as infants, i mean stick straight, butler says.</p>

<p>I’ve no clue how to style it/what cut to get. Wavy hair is also more likely to become frizzy than straight hair. Straight hair can become greasy and limp quickly, so it’s important that it is washed frequently; I don’t use heat tools and i have virgin hair. This works especially well with dirty hair, but sleeping in braids is.</p>
