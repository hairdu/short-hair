<p>I would say that microscopic evaluation of the scalp and hair (a miniaturization study) is probably the most accurate method of predicting the future hair loss in male pattern baldness. Your uneven hairline can be there because of your face asymmetry too. Wrapping it up, these articles on the mature hairline and teenage hair loss may be of interest to you. A lot of people have problems with their hairline.</p>
<h3 id="almost-every-face-has-an-asymmetry">Almost every face has an asymmetry.</h3><p>However, your uneven hairline might be a sign of early stage of balding too. In some people, hair loss from the hairline can be due to pattern baldness. It is a completely preventable condition, brought about by a person’s lifestyle ( 10 ). Hereditary hair loss with age is the most common cause of baldness. You are approaching a nw3 so you are receding slightly beyond a mature hair line. Stop asking why my hair is breaking off in the front, try changing your hair care habit now.</p>
