<p>Make sure you focus more on the spot that is less curly than the rest of your hair when you apply products (kinda obvious, but it never hurts to emphasize it ). I have this minor problem. It almost makes me not want to wear my hair curly sometimes because it just looks so weird to have beautiful coils on.</p>

<p>The layers will not grow down and they seem to be getting shorter due to breakage! Tailor your regimen to your hair’s needs. Log in or sign up to leave a comment. At my deva cut, the stylist said to scrunch the wavy side and rake the curlier side. Some of these genes can be inactive at birth but then.</p>

<p>My hair is wavy to curly except for an 1 1/2 inch section on the top of my head, from my forehead to crown. It creates this really strange looking uneven look. Not being perfectly symetrical isn�t a flaw. No one says you have to use all the same product on all sections of your hair. This is because of.</p>

<p>Get you a boar hair brush for the sides, and a round brush as it gets longer. My sister relaxed her shoulder length hair, and only then did we notice that one side was quite noticeably longer than the other. It creates this really strange looking uneven look. Especially if you massage your scalp with some warmed up jamaican black..</p>

<p>The gene can be inherited from either your mother�s or father�s side of the family, though you�re more likely to have it if both of your parents had hair loss. Some of these genes can be inactive at birth but then become turned on by hormones, aging, or other factors including medication, nutrition, stress, illness, or pollution. If you notice.</p>

<p>It almost makes me not want to wear my hair curly sometimes because it just looks so weird to have beautiful coils on one side and almost bone straight hair on the other side. Oval tubes are oddly shaped on one side which causes the curl. If you notice your hair is going from straight to curly, your hair follicles.</p>

<p>We all have that one side that refuses to cooperate with us, and simstone and her sister were having a debate on whether one can have naturally curly hair in one or more sections and naturally straight on another. Your hair may become curly with age if you inherited both straight and curly hair genes from your parents. In order.</p>

<p>What i mean by curly on bottom and straight on top is underneath my hair by my ears and nape of my neck my hair is very curly, but from the middle of my head up to the top, all the hair is straight. That still only does so much. I can�t cut the top of my hair short in.</p>

<p>If you notice your hair is going from straight to curly, your hair follicles are changing. I think it�s because you�re sleeping on your side, it flattens the hair. I need this to stop because it is very un encouraging. At my deva cut, the stylist said to scrunch the wavy side and rake the curlier side. You may need.</p>
