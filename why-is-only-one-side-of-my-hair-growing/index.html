<p>Does it look the other side will follow or will i always have a weird half hairline. If you have hair on one side of the head that appears to grow longer, faster, stronger, or thicker, it may be a matter of normal variance. This is completely normal and if your beard is growing longer on one side there are a range of simple and quick things you can do to balance it out. A month and a half have passed.</p>
<h3 id="time-alone-can-work-wonders">Time alone can work wonders.</h3><p>Different factors determine the rate of growth of a beard such as stress nutrition, and exercise. My right side which i sleep on grows faster than my left but my left is thicker. But, in some people the phases of loss and growth of hair become irregular and sometime can stop suddenly, leading to thinning of hair or bald spot on head. Also, i think the slowest growing hairs are at my hairline, because every month i measure them and they seem to hardly have budged, yet the rest of my hair looks longer! The back left part of my hair is much longer than the back right part, so at different angles the hair looks longer on one side than the other. In the meantime, feel free to wear a bra and try not to worry.</p>

<p>Well i�m 25 and even i don�t have a complete beard. Others have told me that some of their native hair was shocked out from the minoxidil. I learned in school (physical therapist) that reduced or no hair growth in a specific area of the body can be caused by bad wiring. Watch popular content from the following creators: Nutrients.</p>

<p>Time alone can work wonders. My right side which i sleep on grows faster than my left but my left is thicker. In the mean time try to make the best of it, atleast you wont have to shave the non growing side! Is this a shed ? Or why one side of your hair is thicker than the other?</p>

<p>A month and a half have passed. If the area has had an injury, scar or other irritation this may have affected the hair follicles. But coming this far, my recommendation is to give it more time because the regrowth will happen and eventually catch up. They are not all the same, indicating no real pattern. So like half a.</p>

<p>The back left part of my hair is much longer than the back right part, so at different angles the hair looks longer on one side than the other. Growing up that side was always more receded looking but it’s gotten ridiculous lately. Another funny thing is that my left facial hair are brown but the right ones are black..</p>

<p>The right side of my face had less beard hair than the left side. Some of the most common illnesses are: This is completely normal and if your beard is growing longer on one side there are a range of simple and quick things you can do to balance it out. Some guys have told me that they applied minoxidil.</p>

<p>I take fin ( 14 months now ) and minox ( around 7 to 8 months ). In the meantime, feel free to wear a bra and try not to worry. Have you ever wondered by one side of your hair grows faster than the other side? Thinning hair due to illness and hair thinning on one side. Puberty causes.</p>

<p>Which is why i get so irritated when i�m trying to grow it out. If the area has had an injury, scar or other irritation this may have affected the hair follicles. Because that side doesn�t grow, and it looks like i took scissors and chopped straight across that side, and then the back is long. Sometimes, one side is.</p>

<p>Others have told me that some of their native hair was shocked out from the minoxidil. I noticed that only one side of my hairline is receding. Also, i think the slowest growing hairs are at my hairline, because every month i measure them and they seem to hardly have budged, yet the rest of my hair looks longer! This.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered by one side of your hair grows faster than the other side? When i was relaxed, the section around my ear on right side will out grow the rest of hair to the point, i would have that section cut shorter but it would out grow. As a result, high levels of dht leads to problems.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it may be a matter of external influences. I want to ask her about doing the inverted bob when i get my hair cut. A month and a half have passed. Mary lofrumento, a pediatrician in morristown, n.j. Does it look the other side will follow or will i always have a weird half hairline.</p>
