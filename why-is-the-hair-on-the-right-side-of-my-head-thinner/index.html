Why is my hair thinning in the front, From alqurumresort.com</p>
<p>I�ve been putting rogaine on the right side of my head, but i�m not sure if it is even doing anything. His father (my grandfather) passed away at 65 with no hair loss. This condition is triggered by dht, a breakdown product of testosterone, causing hair follicles to shrink and the hair cycle to shorten—this leads to slower hair growth. (i usually do it in two stages:</p>

Also, when i diffuse my hair, it is impossible to fit sections of the right side of my hair into the diffuser and i�ve got a big ass diffuser. My father is 70 and he has no hair loss. The causes of thinning hair on the sides include traction alopecia, heredity, and certain diseases. However, it exerts a negative toxic impact on the non androgenic head hair. If it is sparser on one side of your head, the less hairs there are, the thinner your hair will feel.</p>

<p>If it is genetic thinning, the other side will eventually catch up unless you treat it. Dht exerts a positive proliferating effect on androgenic hair follicles.

This difference.</p>

Commonly referred to as androgenetic alopecia, pattern baldness causes your hair cycles to shorten and new hairs to have more superficial roots, resulting in hair falling out easier. The thickness of the hair at the top gradually tapers down and thins right above the ears, creating a neat, smooth, taper that slims your facial shape..</p>

<p>It can also be the result of sleeping on the same side for many years. Especially if you massage your scalp with some warmed up jamaican black. My best guess is you possibly sleep on the right side more and are naturally prone to hair loss, because the right side of your hair/head is against the pillow more there is.</p>
