Why does my hair (still) look dry, frizzy, and generally From reddit.com</p>
<p>If your hair is damaged, frizzy or compromised in any way, this will reinstate a soft, silky feel. Basically, when your hair becomes dry it starts to develop moisture. Don‚Äôt‚Ä¶scrub your hair with your towel. Another thing you tell us to help with advice is what your hair properties are, but i know it can be confusing to figure out.</p>

Many fans leave this on overnight to really up the silky, strengthening ante. Check out r/curlyhair and maybe the curly girl method will help you out! The main cause of frizz is lack of moisture in the hair. A much simpler explanation is that when hair is damaged or dry, the outer layer of hair (the cuticle) begins to lift, allowing moisture to pass through and swell hair strands. Thank you so much for this post üòç i had baby curls and then frizzy slightly wavy hair but i always considered it was straight.</p>

<p>I color my hair which helps with the grey texture but i only have grey on the top of my head. If you use/used heat or got a relaxer/perm, then there could be a possibility that it is damaged.

<p>Frizz is so common that while igk was working with google and their retail partners, they learned it‚Äôs the top searched hair term‚Äîeveryone is trying to. Hair in the top layer is more likely to be frizzy because it is the most exposed hair part to pollution, sunlight, humidity, and friction when we sleep. I color my hair which helps.</p>

<p>So the longer you leave it on, the more effective it will be. Damaged waves and curls do not clump as easily and therefore, they will try to push away from other strands causing frizz.
