<p>But it ends up leaving white residue all over my head. Why is the bottom layer of my hair so frizzy? The most disturbing feature, however, is the ringlets and curls underneath the somewhat straight layer hair on top. Layering on the top areas of the hair blended to lengths down the sides and ending around the shoulders (or longer depending on your height and build) will give this look.</p>
<h3 id="it039s-easy-for-them-to-frizz-up">It�s easy for them to frizz up.</h3><p>I wanted the extra volume. The bottom part of the hair, being protected better, is healthier and retain more moisture within the hair shaft, dries slower and tend to have stronger curl. The result in some cases is a rounded silhouette. My first clue as to why you shouldn�t get layers was how quickly my hair fell flat after i got my cut. They�re not weighed down my length or other hair on top. And when the hair dried and gets back to its natural state, the curly hair will shrink up which leaves a huge gap between the hair length and all other layers.</p>

<p>The main cause of frizz is lack of moisture in the hair. Obviously, all kinds of hairstyling can lead to damage, but super tight ponytails, high up on the head, secured with elastic can pull at the hairs on the nape of the neck, making them break and.

<p>The top section like a previous poster is much less curly and covers my pretty curls. To make the top of the hair curls is to condition the hair to absorb moisture and seal in the moisture and set the hair while it is still moist and curly. If the layered haircut is too short, holding it up in a.</p>

<p>Curl shapes range from tight coils to ringlets but also irregular curl patterns. Dry hair absorbs moisture from the air, causing frizz, which also explains why humidity can make frizz even worse! It does tangle so so easily, while the rest of my hair currently only needs detangeling like once a week. My first clue as to why you shouldn�t.</p>

<p>The most disturbing feature, however, is the ringlets and curls underneath the somewhat straight layer hair on top. I guess multiple textures is one explanation.

<p>Coily hair is much drier than straight, wavy and curly hair. Adding some long layers, starting from the chin down, will help to take out some of the weight and create a better shape. But somehow my hair isnt acting the same as before. For example, the “afro” style is a short layered cut. They�re not weighed down my length.</p>

<p>Adding some long layers, starting from the chin down, will help to take out some of the weight and create a better shape. Moreover, excessive heating can also change your hair color to gold. My hair color is now a blend of silver, brown and black. It is my theory that hair does this because the top part has nothing.</p>

<p>It is my theory that hair does this because the top part has nothing to weigh it down, so all your little hairs are standing up, reaching out to the water in the air. My hair also hates being wet and loses several inches once it. Therefore, just make sure before doing the haircut, you explain very well and clearly.</p>

<p>It does tangle so so easily, while the rest of my hair currently only needs detangeling like once a week. The main cause of frizz is lack of moisture in the hair.

<p>That said, if you are going to dry your hair, be sure to add a diffuser attachment onto your blow dryer to help limit the amount of direct heat and forceful air hitting your strands. Moreover, constant use of hair dye can also damage the pattern of your hair. The process of having your hair layered inadvertently requires the loss.</p>
