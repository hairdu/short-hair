<p>Straight hair follicles grow straight out but curly hair follicles have a hook shape. When your hair lacks moisture, it becomes brittle and begins to lift, causing the hair to look bushy. A person with curly hair should not comb their hair dry because that will damage their curl pattern, and will cause a lot of frizz and breakage. Lack.</p>
