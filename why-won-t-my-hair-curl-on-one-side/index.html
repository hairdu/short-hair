<h3 id="although-hair-is-a-much-studied-topic-some-aspects-still-remain-a-mystery-including-why-straight-hair-suddenly-becomes-curly-or-vice-versa">Although hair is a much studied topic some aspects still remain a mystery, including why straight hair suddenly becomes curly or vice versa.</h3><p>This trick is especially important if you’re using a curling iron with a clamp.

It does, however, come with often unwanted side effects of slippery styling. This condition can be present after the facial nerve is damaged or injured. I usually just do deep conditioning and oil, but i�m always looking for new products that won�t make.</p>
