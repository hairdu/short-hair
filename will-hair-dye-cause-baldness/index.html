<p>Overexposing your hair to hair dyes may lead to hair breaking off at its root thereby exposing it directly to the chemicals contained in the dye. However, hair dye products contain certain chemicals that if misused or over used can result in damage to hair follicles or your scalp and cause hair loss from hair dye. Peroxide is necessary to remove the eumelanin pigments from the hair shaft and replace them with blonde colors. Hair dyes that lighten hair from its natural color are the most disruptive as they contain high volumes of peroxide.</p>
<h3 id="regular-dyeing-andor-bleaching-can-cause-dry-or-brittle-hair-but-no-permanent-baldness-nor-can-it-speed-up-getting-bald">Regular dyeing and/or bleaching can cause dry or brittle hair but no permanent baldness nor can it speed up getting bald.</h3><p>This can increase the production of free radicals, which damage cells and tissues, leading to hair loss or thinning hair. The short answer to this question is yes, dyeing your hair can lead to hair loss. However, clearly not everyone who dyes their hair loses it, so what gives?
