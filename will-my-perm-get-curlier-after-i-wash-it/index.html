<p>After that, take your perm solution and apply it in a circular motion. Why did my perms go flat? When to wash hair after perm? One of the most common misconceptions is that you must wait 48 hours before using the shampoo after a perm. Do you mean perm your hair with the braids in.</p>

<p>Even though your hair is curly, it doesn�t mean it�s impossible to do any of the hairstyles you used to do before the treatment. To moisturize the stressed hair while washing, you should use a conditioner and match the products to the stressed hair. However, if the perm was given properly on healthy hair, there would be just as much.</p>

<p>It will stay curly even after you�ve washed and dried your hair! Can i wash my hair 24 hours after a perm? Will my perms get curlier after i wash my hair? After some time, receiving a second perm would help to convince your hair, it�s curly now. Scrunching your hair is similar to crumpling up a piece of paper,.</p>

<p>Wash and dry it right. My hair pattern appears to have gotten curlier over time. Once it’s time to wash, use warm water rather than hot because the heat can ruin your curls. If you dont scrunch it, it wont be as curled as you like it to be. Well…not exactly how it goes but okay, to each their own.</p>

<p>The longer you let it air dry, the more defined each curl will be. It would not appear so because of the tension. The perm reconstructs the hair from straight to curly. While you may have to pay attention to washing your hair after a perm, blow drying your hair will have the same effects on your hair as before..</p>

<p>Unlike hair dyes, perms can�t wash out. If you have hard to perm hair, which many people do, after your perm solution is applied and rinsed out, adding a last step of rinsing your hair with apple cider vinegar and water solution does wonders for helping your hair adhere to the perm. After that, take your perm solution and apply.</p>

<p>If your chemically permed hair curls more after washing, it’s temporary. In the shower, scrunch your hair instead of running your fingers through it to wash it and such. If you do not take proper care and use the right products, your perms might go flat soon. You can try finger coils or scrunch the hair after your first wash.</p>

<p>Even though your hair is curly, it doesn�t mean it�s impossible to do any of the hairstyles you used to do before the treatment. Simply because the strong airflow of a diffuser hits the curls much harder and if they haven’t had time to dry in their shape, they’ll get messy. Why did my perms go flat? Unlike hair dyes,.</p>

<p>Wash and dry it right. Do you mean perm your hair with the braids in. If you do not take proper care and use the right products, your perms might go flat soon. Once it’s time to wash, use warm water rather than hot because the heat can ruin your curls. You can try finger coils or scrunch the hair.</p>

<p>Now, it’s time to wait until the solution does its trick. Water is in fact essential for a perm as it reactivates the curls. No brushing, only use a wide tooth comb. Wait at least 24 hours after perming to wash your hair. Work one rod at a time.</p>
